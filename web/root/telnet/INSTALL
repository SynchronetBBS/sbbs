** The Java(tm) Telnet Applet **

-------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use the classes only do the following:

* UNIX:
	gzip -cd telnet.tgz | tar xf - \*.class

* DOS/Windows:
	pkunzip -d telnet.zip
	* Maybe you can unzip it by just clicking on the
	  package or Netscape knows how to handle .zip.

This will extract the classes and create the required 
directory structure (/ is \ on DOS/Windows):

	telnet.class
	socket/TelnetIO.class
	socket/StatusPeer.class
	display/CharDisplay.class
	display/Terminal.class
	display/TerminalHost.class
	display/vt320.class
	modules/ButtonBar.class
	modules/Script.class

-------------------------------------------------------------
In case you like to compile the sources yourself extract
everything and type the following:

	make realclean
	make telnet.class

The Makefile will compile all classes recursively even though
the java compiler would do this by itself when running 
"java telnet.java".

Just typing "make" will print you all available make targets:

	make test         - compile applet and run appletviewer
	make telnet       - compile standalone and run telnet
	make doc          - create documentation
	make clean        - delete backup files
	make realclean    - make clean and delete .class files

-------------------------------------------------------------

Hint: Always remember that the applet can only connect to the
      server it has been loaded from! You will get a security
      exception when trying to connect to some other host.

      If you load your applet locally via the file:// URL
      don't forget to set the CLASSPATH environment variable
      to the directory, where the telnet.class resides _before_
      you start your appletviewer or web browser!
