; SyncTERM (CTerm) Loadable and Alternative Fonts Configuration

; ********************
; Character Dimensions
; ********************
; The supported font character/glyph heights are: 8, 14, or 16 pixels.
; The supported font character widths are always 8 pixels.

; These are standard IBM CGA/VGA text mode character dimensions.

; The utilized character height depends on the terminal's screen mode:
; 8h fonts are used for screen modes with 35 or more lines
; 14h fonts are used for screen modes with 28 and 34 lines
; 16h fonts are used for screen modes with 30 lines or fewer than 28 lines

; When a user's terminal has a 'status bar', the above lines are decremented by
; one but the character heights still apply (e.g. a 33 line terminal will use a
; 14h font).

; Since 80x25/24 is the most common BBS terminal mode, 8x16 fonts are the most
; commonly used/applicable.

; **********
; Font Slots
; **********

; The global section here is for associating names with font slot numbers.
; Synchronet uses the highest slot numbers for dynamically loading XBin/XBimage
; fonts - so do not assign or use slots 252 through 255.
; SyncTERM currently preserves slots 0-42 for hard-coded pre-defined fonts,
; so these slot are not available for BBS-loaded fonts and its possible that
; future versions of SyncTERM may have more hard-coded fonts. So the "safe"
; slot numbers to use for BBS-loaded fonts is the 100-250 range, which
; "should" be plenty.

; Hard-coded Fonts
; ----------------
; SyncTERM 1.0 has the following hard-coded fonts/slots
; (with the supported character heights commented at the end of each line).
; You probably don't need to change anything in this section.

; BBS-Loadable Fonts
; ------------------
; These font slot numbers (in the 100-250) range are available for BBS use.
;
; We are just naming the slot numbers here for later convenient reference.
; You could assign the same slot number to multiple fonts, but then you could
; not have more than one of those fonts "active" at the same time. There are
; plenty of available slot numbers, so we assign a unique slot for every
; loadable font, just in case you want more than one active simultaneously (and
; you probably will).
;
; A single font may have a version/file for more than one character height.
; The supported character heights are commented at the end of each line.
;
; Feel free to add more fonts to this section as you add/discover them.

; *****************
; Filename Sections
; *****************

; These filenames are only needed if the base filename does not match the name
; we assigned to the slot (above). So mostly, we don't need these sections
; so long as we just use names that match the base filenames of the font files.
;
; The Filename Section names are "filenames:<charheight>" where <charheight>
; is the relevant font character height, in pixels.

; Font files (in the Synchronet ctrl/fonts directory):
; 8x8 are in *.f8 files, 8x14 are in *.f14 files, and 8x16 are in *.f16 files.

; ***********************
; Active Fonts and Styles
; ***********************

; 200+ fonts may be loaded into the terminal (SyncTERM) at any time, but only 4
; fonts may be "active" (visibly used) at any given time. Which of the fonts are
; visibly used for any particular text is determined by the combination of the
; character display attributes or styles:
;   1: normal
;   2: high-intensity (bright)
;   3: normal-blinking
;   4: high-intensity blinking
;
; These 4 styles are referred to later as normal, high, blink, and highblink.
;
; Since there are only 4 available styles, there are only 4 possible fonts at
; any given time. However, the BBS may change the font (slot) used for a
; particular text style at any time and the characters on the terminal screen
; which have been displayed in that style will change to use the new font,
; immediately. So the BBS may drastically affect the appearance of all the
; characters (text and "graphics") displayed on the remote terminal without
; re-sending any of those characters!

; ****************************
; Loading and Activating Fonts
; ****************************

; Within each Font Section, there are 2 types of 'key=value' assignments:
; Font Loads (data transfers) and Font Activations
;
; Font Loads use the form: '<slot>=<filename>'
;       where <slot> is either a font slot number or slot name (from above)
;       and <filename> is the name of a file from the BBS's fonts directory.
;       This syntax is used when you want to pre-load a font and not immediately
;       activate it; you probably don't need to use this syntax.
;
; Font Activations use the form: '<style>=<slot>'
;       where <style> is one of: 'normal', 'high', 'blink', or 'highblink'
;       (describes the attribute combination which will use the activated font)
;       and <slot> is either a font slot number or slot name (from above).
;       The font will be loaded (transferred to the terminal) if it has not
;       already been loaded at any time during this connection/session, so an
;       activation assignment implies: "load the font if it hasn't already".
;       With this scheme, fonts may be activated, deactivated, and reactivated
;       later without re-sending (loading into the terminal) the font data,
;       which can cause a noticeable pause.

; *************
; Font Sections
; *************

; Font Sections are named with the following form: '[<key>:<char>]'
; where <key> is a keyword used by the BBS to load and/or activate one or more
; fonts relevant to a particular use of the BBS (e.g. door game) and
; <char> is the character height, in pixels, which corresponds with the user's
; terminal screen length (see above descriptions, but 16 is most common).

; Default Sections
; ----------------
; The 'default' key/sections are used to define the set of fonts to be loaded
; and activated during logon or answer, if so configured, and potentially
; re-activated several times during a BBS user session/connection. The 'default'
; fonts will be re-activated when the BBS user returns from running an external
; program or loadable module that might have changed the active fonts.

[default:16]
normal=cp437
high=courier
blink=gothical
highblink=computer

[default:14]
normal=cp437
high=courier
blink=oldenglish
highblink=computer

[default:8]
normal=cp437
high=bold

; Door Sections
; -------------
; Each BBS external online program (e.g. door game) may have its own desired
; fonts and some programs may even have customized fonts made just for that
; game (e.g. LORE).
; 
; These sections are named with the form: '[xtrn:<code>:<char>]
; where <code> is the external program's Internal Code (as configured in SCFG)
; and <char> is the relevant character height.
;
; Note: you must utilize xtrn_sec.js rev 1.18 or later for this feature:

[xtrn:lore:16]
normal=lore
high=lore
blink=lore
highblink=lore

[xtrn:lord:16]
normal=lore

[xtrn:lord:14]
normal=oldenglish

; Other Sections
; --------------
; Any other BBS script or module may load and/or activate fonts referenced
; in this file (using "load('fonts'.js', 'modname')"). The author or
; documentation associated with those modules should instruct you of the section
; name to use to define the utilized fonts, when applicable.
