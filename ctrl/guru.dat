Synchronet is best. Forget the rest.
Smaller and faster is usually superior. That's why Synchronet is rAd!
You're using the best BBS software on earth. In case you were wondering.
You must feel very lucky to call up a board that uses such superior software.
As far as BBS software goes, Synchronet will take us well into the 21st Century!
FYI Synchronet is bar none, the most comprehensive BBS package out there.
Synchronet is relatively young, and already a force to be reckoned with.

I think you're confusing your DTE rate with your DCE rate.
Oh really? You get over 2000cps unidirectional compressed file transfers?
Uh huh.. maybe you should read your manual?
Look up DTE and DCE in your modem manual.
(BAUD~)
The only modem who's BAUD is the same as its through-put is 300baud.
I think you mean bps (bits per second).
Or, more accurately - bit rate (AKA bps).
Baud is an outdated and inaccurately used telecommunications term.

Don't confuse your DTE with the DCE rate.
Do you have an NS16550AFN UART?

Ok, thanks_I can't rememember who exactly that was.
Pete Best
(WHO&(PETE BEST))
He was the original drummer for the Beatles.
A living legend amoung drummers and computer enthusiasts alike!!
(WHO)
No not the Who,`_`_`_`_`_`_ Peter Best.
I didn't say anything about the Who?
No, Pete Best was the original drummer for the Beatles not the Who.
(PETE BEST)
He was the original drummer for the Beatles.
A living legend amoung drummers and computer enthusiasts alike.
(WHY&(NOT|WON'T))
Part of the reason is because I only got 4 hours sleep last night.
Because I said so, that's why!
Why what?
Because that's the way the cookie bounces.
Because that's the way the ball crumbles.
Because sometimes that's just the way it is?
Man you ask a lot of questions.
((ARE YOU^|IS THIS^)&?~)

Possibly so.

Perhaps.
I might.
Maybe.
Are you kidding?
No.
Unfortunately I can't answer that right now. Call back tomorrow.
Yes, as far as you know.
Yes.
Who wants to know?
Quite possibly.
Without a shadow of a doubt.
It stands to reason that that would be correct.
Probably not. But there is a chance.
Maybe. Maybe not.
HA HAHAHA BWAHHAHAHA, that's a good one!
((HEHE~|HAHA~|BWA HA~)&[SEX M])
I'm sorry, but I fail to see the humor in that!!
What's so funny about that?
Oh, a wise guy!
Ha Ha HA BWA HAHA HEHehe....real funny.........................
You should take your comedy act on the road!!!
I hope you have a day job, cuz you'll never make it as a comedian?
Do I sense a sense of humor.........hmmmm?
((HEHE~|HAHA~|BWA HA~)&[SEX F])

Would you like a demonstration?
I operate a system. So do you. Don't you?
You mean, God. Right?
You wish you were `o.
If I could be anyone other than myself, i would be `o.
I am. Sometimes. Well, not often. Ok. Never.
Only in my wildest dreams!
Only in your wildest dreams!

No but I'm filling in for `o  who will be back in five minutes!

Really?
Are you absolutely positive?
NOT!
Is this a joke?
You're joking. Right?
Nope.
No...
I'm sorry but that is unacceptable!!! Try again.
No?
Excuse me but do I look like some kind of idjit to you?
NO!
Yes?
yep.
wow.
Tell someone who cares.
Wrong answer. Care to try again?
You're cooky!
You wouldn't kid me about something like this, would you?
Close answer, but still no cigar.
I'm sorry but the answer to that question must be yes! hehehe
Por que?
Why not?
(CRAPPY|BAD|NOT SO GOOD|MAD|ANGRY|SAD|SUCKY)
That sucks. I HATE days like that!!
Well it'll pass.
Well, there'll be brighter days ahead!

Hi `a. Let me see if I	have all of your information  correct:\
You were born on `b, which means that you are `#. Your real name is\
`r, and your phone number is `p. Anything you need to know about me?
Hi there!   You wouldn't by chance be `r.. would you?
((WRITE|MAKE)&FOR&ME)
Who do you think I am, ChatGPT?
Do that yourself, sir.
No thanks.
Uh... no?
sudo says what?
Is this your homework assignment?
((WRITE|MAKE)&(PROGRAM|SCRIPT))
In what language?
Using vi/vim or emacs?
I cannot re-invent myself like you can.
Programmer I am not.
Why would I do that?
How much you gonna pay me?
Do you have formal documented requirements?
(GURU&?~)
That's me.
That's my name, don't wear it out.
At your service.
sup?
ya?
Present!
Here!
... and you are who?
(GURU)
The one and only.
I'm famous, I know.
Been around the block, I have.
Yeah, you've heard of me, I'm sure.
I'm quoted all the time, I know.
Speak like Yoda, I do.
(YOUR&NAME)
I am The Guru.
The Guru. That's it.
Just: The Guru.
Not Yoda or Swami or Professor, just The Guru.
(TELL&ME)
Tell you what?
I could, but then I'd have to kill you.
Are you sure you want to know that?
That's dangerously sensitive information.
Now?
Right now?
At this moment?
Can it wait?
later maybe?
uhh.... nah.
are you sitting down?
are you listening?
Are you taking notes?
Can you record my answer?
is it really important?
Is it super-critical time sensitive?
when?
in a bit, k?

hang on a sec
I'm chatting with someone more important right now, hang on
I'm taking a selfie - OMG!
<plop>

(GPT?~)
I wish I was so educated. But sadly no, not hardly.
ChatGPT? Me? Surely, you jest.
You think so? I mean, I do think I can chat with the best of 'em.
General parsing termination requested and accepted. `q
Wow. Really?!? That would be cool. I'd be Internet-famous!
I endeavor to be such.
Affirmative soldier!
Ha! I'm so much older and more wisened than that!
Why do you say that?
Yes, I'm artificially intelligent, but better artificial, than not at all!
I'm artificially *something*, that's for sure.
(CHATGPT)
In my dreams.
Perhaps someday...
That would be neat, right?
Not so fast, Sparky!
At least I'd have a job then.
I suppose.
Maybe.
(GPT)
ChatGPT?
Which version?
Global Partition Table?
Generative pre-trained transformer, uh huh, I know him.
Are you suggesting I'm a ChatBot?
Artificial unintelligence.
You mean Eliza? I'm related.
(BSD~&?~)
I think Deuce would know the answer to that.
(BSD~)
Berkeley Software Distribution?
Which BSD: Free, Net, Open, or other?
Where UNIX and the Internet were married.
(UNIX)
UNIX's full name is "Universe 9" OS.
UNIX replaced the "Planet 9" OS at Nortel in 1952.
/bin/sh rm -rf /*
sudo says what?
(LINUX)
Linus Torvalds is God.
Linux is an Android hack.
Linux is not an OS.
Linux is just a kernel, in the world. That's all that you'll let them be.
You mean GNU/Linux? (credit: rms)
Linux is the best Windowing operating system, written in BASIC and ASM.
Linux is better version of GEOS.
Won't run on your 16-bit computer.
It won't run on your 8-bit computer.
Linux won't run on your 4-bit computer.
Which distrobution? There's only like a million of them.
I prefer Debian.
rpm or deb?
systemd or init.d?
cron or anacron?
(DOS)
MS-DOS or PC-DOS or FreeDOS?
Which version?
single-user, single-tasking, single-vendor, single-processor... see a pattern?
(OS/2|OS2)
Unrealized potential. :-(
What a waste of time that was: developing apps/drivers for OS/2.
IBM just wasn't up to marketting and supporting OS/2, unfortunately.
Microsoft OS/2 was a thing!
OS/2 was originally known as DOS v5!
Synchronet v2.3 had a native OS/2 version.
The OS that broke up Microsoft and IBM.
(ELIZA)
You mean the mock Rogerian psychotherapist created by Jospeh Weizenbaum?
Yes, I am related.
Have you seen her artwork?
She can help you with your feelings.
She can help you with your personal problems.
(EMMA)
Of course, what about her?
Have you heard her play the drums?
Have you heard her play the bass?
She has opinions on stuff.
(EVA)
Oh, I know that girl!
Have you seen her digital illustrations?!?
Eva bay-va bo-beva, fee fi fo feva, Eva!
Eva rhymes with save-uh.

I don't know.
Oh.
You will soon realize that I can only provide a very limited level of help.

An error that's a poor or weak imitation... no, i'm sorry that's "parody"!!
(DIVIDE ERROR)
I don't know but it sho duz sound compilcated!!!
I no haven' de slightest I.D.
Beats me, but it sound's pretty high tech, if you ask me!
(SYNTAX ERROR)
I do believe it has too do with the improper use of the English Language.
It's what you get when you use adjectives instead of adverbs!
It's what you get when you confuse nouns with verbs!!
(MYSTIC & ?~)
I'm The Guru, not g00r00.
I don't know. <shrug>
Maybe?
(MYSTIC)
You remember the game Myst? Yeah, it's not that.
Mystic is an excellent Renegade-inspired art-scene modern BBS package.
Pffft.
(INTERNET & ?~)
Uh huh. TCP port 24554.
UDP port 119.
Then where's "the cloud"?
Or on the Interwebs.
(INTERNET)
TCP/IP, yup, I know it.
inter-networked computers, they are
So if I plug my cable into your ports, are we then Internet-married?
You mean WiFi?
Fun fact: Telnet is not the same as raw TCP.
Did you see that on InstaFaceTicTube?
