(SYNCHRO~|BBS|SBBS|BULLETIN|(SYNC~&NET~))
Synchronet is best. Forget the rest.
Smaller and faster is usually superior. That's why Synchronet is rAd!
You're using the best BBS software on earth. In case you were wondering.
You must feel very lucky to call up a board that uses such superior software.
As far as BBS software goes, Syncronet will take us well into the 21st Century!
FYI Syncronet is bar none, the most comprehensive BBS package out there.
Syncronet is relatively young, and already a force to be reckoned with.

I think you're confusing your DTE rate with your DCE rate.
Oh really? You get over 2000cps unidirectional compressed file transfers?
Uh huh.. maybe you should read your manual?
Look up DTE and DCE in your modem manual.
(BAUD~)
The only modem who's BAUD is the same as its through-put is 300baud.
I think you mean bps (bits per second).
Or, more accurately - bit rate (AKA bps).
Baud is an outdated and inaccurately used telecommunications term.
(MODEM|HST~|V.32~|V32~|BIS~|V42~|V.42~)
I know all about modems.
Try ATZ
Try AT&F
Try ATS2=46

Try ATS0=0E1H0M1Q0V1X4&C1&D2
Try reading the manual.
Do you actually own a modem?
What do you want to know?
uh huh...
Don't confuse your DTE with the DCE rate.
Do you have an NS16550AFN UART?
Does yours make funny noises too?
I can't get mine to work either.

If it wasn't for IBM, I'd be out a job!

I'm a politician of sorts.

Ok, thanks_I can't rememember who exactly that was.
Pete Best
(WHO&(PETE BEST))
He was the original drummer for the Beatles.
A living legend amoung drummers and computer enthusiasts alike!!
(WHO)
No not the Who,`_`_`_`_`_`_ Peter Best.
I didn't say anything about the Who?
No, Pete Best was the original drummer for the Beatles not the Who.
(PETE BEST)
He was the original drummer for the Beatles.
A living legend amoung drummers and computer enthusiasts alike.
(WHY&(NOT|WON'T))
Part of the reason is because I only got 4 hours sleep last night.
Because I said so, that's why!
Why what?
Because that's the way the cookie bounces.
Because that's the way the ball crumbles.
Because sometimes that's just the way it is?
Man you ask a lot of questions.

Perhaps.

Maybe.
Are you kidding?
No.
Unfortunately I can't answer that right now. Call back tomorrow.
Yes, as far as you know.
Yes.
Who wants to know?
Quite possibly.
Without a shadow of a doubt.
It stands to reason that that would be correct.
Probably not. But there is a chance.
Maybe. Maybe not.

You mean you want to USE the BBS?
You're asking me? Ba ahab hahaha hAHA HA
you're funny.
I don't know.
Oh.
You will soon realize that I can only provide a very limited level of help.
(PARITY ERROR)
Oh just something I made up to make you think I was smart!
An error that's a poor or weak imitation... no, i'm sorry that's "parody"!!
(DIVIDE ERROR)
I don't know but it sho duz sound compilcated!!!
I no haven' de slightest I.D.
Beats me, but it sound's pretty high tech, if you ask me!
(SYNTAX ERROR)
I do believe it has too do with the improper use of the English Language.
It's what you get when you use adjectives instead of adverbs!
It's what you get when you confuse nouns with verbs!!
((?~)&[SEX M])
Sometimes it better to figure these questions out on our own!
I could tell you, but then it wouldn't be safe for you nor I!
Wow, I guess you stumped me on that one.
Pick a number, divide it by two, multiple by the square root... \
That's your answer!
Everyone has asked me that today... I'm too tired to answer.
Your answer lies in the question!
Your question lies in the answer, or maybe it's the other way around?!!
I know. I'm just not sayen.
You know... I know you know. Ya know?
Nevermind your questions... I've got a few of my own!
I'll have to research that and get back to you. How's a week from today?
Ask `a he'll know.
Ask me later. I might care then.
Dial `p and ask for `a. He'll know.
I'll send you the answer in e-mail. It's not safe...
Don't ask the Sysop that, or he'll delete you!
Wow, if I were `o, I'd delete you.

Sometimes it's better to figure out these qustions on your own.
I could tell you `a, but then neither of us would be safe....
Wow. you stumped me on that one!
Pick a number, divide it by two, and multiply by the square root of 471!!!
That's your answer!!
Dearest `a, your answer lies within the question.
Your question lies in the answer, or maybe it's the other way around....
I know. But I ain't sayen, darlin'.
Ask `a. She'll know.
You should speak to my wife, `a; she could probably help you..
Heheheheh.  Why should I answer that?
Please refer to page 25 of your manual!
Give me some time to research it and get back to you...
Dial `p, and ask for `r. She should know!
I received some e-mail from `r, and even though she touched on what you are\
asking about, she asked me not to discuss this with anyone...
I'll send you the answer in e-mail. It's not safe otherwise with `o always \
nosing around the chat section.
Wow, if I were `o, I'd delete you for asking a question like that...
You might wanna leave some e-mail for `s and ask him.
