; The following keys can be in either an area-specific key (the fido area name
; is the key) or in the global section.
;
; Dir=XXX		The Synchronet directory internal code to import files into
;
;               If not specified, file will not be imported to the BBS
;               In the global section acts as a default dir.
;
; Path=XXX		The path to place files in.
;
;               If not specified, and a Dir is specified, the storage location
;				of the dir will be used.
;
;               If not specified and Dir is also not specified, the file will
;				not be imported and will not be forwarded downstream.
;
; Links=XXX,YYY	A list of downlinks to forward files to.
;				Note that .FLO files will be created for these, so this can
;               not be a routed address.
;				The TIC password will be the packet password.
;				If in the section, replaces the global
;
; Note that Dir and Path are currently mutually exclusive at the same level and
; that either one in a section will override the global value.
