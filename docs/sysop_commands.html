<h2><u>[5.1] - </u><a name="Sysop Definition"><u>Sysop Definition</u></a></h2>

<pre>There is usually one sysop (System Operator) per BBS - the owner and operator
of the hardware which Synchronet is running on and accepting remote users.
Quite often systems require more than one sysop and Synchronet is flexible in
this respect. Within Synchronet, a sysop is defined as any user with a main
level of 90 or above. Any user that qualifies as a sysop, is prompted with an
&quot;SY:&quot; to enter the system password at logon. Any time a sysop attempts to
perform a sysop function that may breach the system security, he is prompted
with an &quot;SY:&quot; to enter the system password before he can proceed. Users with
sysop access can cause serious damage to the system. Give out this ability with
caution.</pre>

<h2><u>[5.2] - </u><a name="Multiple Sysops"><u>Multiple Sysops</u></a></h2>

<pre>As stated above, any user with a security level of 90 or greater can perform
sysop functions, &quot;So why have levels 91-99?&quot; you might ask yourself. Well, you
can still restrict a user with sysop access from accessing Message Groups or
Sub-boards or File Libraries or Directories by setting the minimum required
level above that user's level. For example: If you have a remote sysop with a
security level of 90, you can still have a Message Group or Sub-board with a
minimum required level of 91. Now this remote sysop will not be able to access
that Group or Sub-board. While it is true that sysops can edit their own
and subbordinate user's accounts, they can not edit a sysop of higher level's
account (when calling remotely). A remote sysop can't raise any user's level
above his own, or add flags or exemptions that he himself doesn't have.</pre>

<h2><u>[5.3] - </u><a name="Local Sysop"><u>Local Sysop</u></a></h2>

<pre>Most sysop functions will be performed locally, while some sysop functions can
only be performed locally. The following special key combination are only
available while online locally (not from the Waiting for Call screen).

<u><b>Macros:</b>
</u>        All the function keys (F1-F12) and combinations with Shift, Ctrl, and
        Alt (48 macros total) are available for the sysop. A macro is a short
        way to enter many keystrokes. Each macro is stored in a seperate file
        in the TEXT directory with a MAC extension. The name reflects which
        key combination will initiate the macro. For regular F1 through F12,
        the name is F1.MAC through F12.MAC respectively. For Alt-F1 through
        Alt-F12 the name is ALT-F1.MAC through ALT-F12, Ctrl-F1 through
        Ctrl-F12 are named CTRL-F1.MAC through CTRL-F12, and Shift-F1 through
        Shift-F12 are named SHFT-F1.MAC through SHFT-F12. Each file is a basic
        ASCII text file with one exception; an extended key combination (such
        as Alt-D) can be entered by placing a Ctrl-@ (ASCII 0, NULL) in the
        file followed by the scan code of the key you wish to use.

<b><u>Alt-key combinations:
</u></b>
<b>        Alt-U           (User Edit)
</b>        At any place within Synchronet, pressing Alt-U at the local keyboard 
        will pop the local console into User Edit while the remote side (if 
        there is a remote user) will see [WAIT]. Alt-U is available while using
        the terminal mode as well. See User Edit for more information.
        See UEDIT command below.
        
<b>        Alt-#           (Quick Validation)
</b>        Pressing Alt and then any of the numbers 0-9 will change the current 
        users level/flags/exemptions/restrictions/credits and extend their
        expiration date to the settings for that quick-validation slot set in
	the system configuration. SCFG-&gt;System-&gt;Toggle Options-&gt;Quick
	Validation Hot Keys must be set to 'Yes' for this feature to work.
        
<b>        Alt-S           (Crazy Cursor Toggle)
</b>        Pressing Alt-S will toggle the state of the crazy (spinning) cursor,
        but doesn't change the current user's default settings regarding it.

<b>        Alt-E           (Local I/O Only)
</b>        If a user is on remotely, this allows the local console to use the BBS
        while the remote user just sees [WAIT]. Pressing Alt-E again re-enables
        the remote console.

<b>        Alt-L           (Capture)
</b>        This starts and stops the local capture of text to a file. If capture
        is active the status line will reflect this state with a blinking 'C'
        as the far left character. The file the BBS opens to capture to will be
        appended if the file already exists. The filename to capture to is
        prompted for when capture is started. The filename defaults to
        CAPTURE.TXT in the current node's directory. To direct output to the
        printer, change the filename to PRN.
        See ANSCAP command below.

<b>        Alt-Q           (Quiet Remote User)
</b>        If a user is connected remotely, hitting this key will disable him from
        being able to enter any keystrokes into the BBS . The user will see all
        the BBSs output, but any characters sent from his side will not be
        accepted as input. Hitting Alt-Q again enables remote input again.

<b>        Alt-P           (Sysop Page Off)
</b>        If someone is currently paging the local sysop (annoying sounds at the
        local console), hitting Alt-P will turn them off. Scroll-lock toggles
        local sysop availability.

<b>        Alt-H           (Disconnect)
</b>        Hangs up on the current user immediately.

<b>        Alt-I           (Interrupt)
</b>        Hangs up on the current user after displaying a message the node has
        been closed for maintenance.
        See INTR command below.

<b>        Alt-A           (Sysop Alert)
</b>        When the current user logs off the BBS, the local sysop will be alerted
	by a message and a continuous alarm.

<b>        Alt-R           (Rerun Node)
</b>        When the current user logs off the BBS, this node will automatically
        rerun itself.
        See RERUN command below.

<b>        Alt-X           (Down Node After User Logs Off)
</b>	Hitting this key combination while the user is in the BBS will toggle
        the down status of this node. When a node is to be downed, it will
        be automatically shutdown when the current user logs off.
        See DOWN command below.

<b>        Alt--           (Subtracts 5 Minutes)
</b>        Subtracts 5 minutes from the users time allowed online this logon.

<b>        Alt-+           (Add 5 Minutes)
</b>        Add 5 minutes to the user's time allowed online this logon.

<b>        Alt-N           (Lock Node)
</b>        Pressing this key will disallow any non-sysops or users without the
        'N' exemption from logging on after the current user logs off.
        See LOCK command below.

<b>        Alt-T           (Temp Sysop)
</b>        Gives the current user sysop status temporarily for this logon. Hitting
        Alt-T again removes the temp sysop status. This doesn't actually raise
        the security level of the user to 90, but gives him access to all sysop
        functions. The status line reflects Temp Sysop state with a blinking
        asterisk to the far left of the status line.

<b>        Alt-G           (Guru Chat)
</b>        Pops the user in and out of apparent local chat with the system's guru.

<b>        Alt-C           (Local Chat)
</b>        Pops the user into chat with the local console.

<b>        Alt-D           (DOS Shell)
</b>        Pops the local console into DOS. If a user is on remotely, he sees
        [WAIT] till the local console exits the shell. The sysop can use the
        'D' command to shell to DOS from the wait for call screen.
        See DOS command below.

<b>        Alt-Z           (Local Key Menu)
</b>        Displays the local key menu.

<b><u>Status Line:
</u></b>
        The status line displays one line of user information at any given
        time. To change the current line, use CTRL and the UP and DOWN arrow
        keys to scroll through different information lines, or CTRL-HOME to go
        to the  default (1st) or CTRL-END to go to the last.

        The available status lines are:

         0: UserName SecLevel Password ModemType Birthday Age Sex Phone
         1: UserName SecLevel RealName/CompanyName &quot;Alt-Z for help&quot;

        16: SysopComment

        You can set the default status line number in SCFG-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced
        options. This will be the default status line that appears until
        manually scrolled.

        There are status flags on the status line that indicate specific status
        items. They appear blinking on the left or right edges of the status
        line. They are defined as:

        C       Local text/ANSI capture is on
        *       Temporary sysop status
        A       Alert sysop when user logs off
        R       Rerun this node when user logs off
        D       Down this node when user logs off
        E       Run node daily event when user logs off
        L       This node is locked for sysop logons only</pre>

<h2><u>[5.4] - </u><a name="Extra Online Sysop Commands"><u>Extra Online Sysop Commands</u></a></h2>

<pre>Most of the additional commands available to sysops online (local or remote)
are initiated from the main or transfer sections. A menu of the available
commands can be viewed with the '!' command from the main or transfer sections
with the Synchronet Classic command shell. Additional sysop commands are
available in many other sections of the BBS and are displayed after the normal
menu with the '?' command. All sysop commands from the main or transfer
sections of the Synchronet Classic command shell begin with a semicolon (';')
character, end with CR (ENTER), and some have optional parameters (shown in
square brackets). Users with certain exemptions can use some of these commands
and have access to the menus via the '!' command using the Synchronet Classic
command shell.


<b>        UEDIT [x]       (User Edit)
</b>        This command initiates the User Edit function. If 'x' is specified
        and is a valid user number, that user will be the current user when
        User Edit starts, otherwise the user online will be the current user.
        This command is also available from the transfer menu. Locally, Alt-U
        is the preferred method of initiating User Edit.
        See the chapter on User Edit for more information.

<b>        CHUSER          (Change into Another User)
</b>        This command allows the sysop to temporarily change to another user
        account. If changing to an account with a higher level, the password
        of that user must be given. Changing to an account of non-sysop status
        automatically enables Temp Sysop mode so that the sysop can change back
        to his/her own account before logging off (a suggested action).

<b>        ANSCAP          (Toggle ANSI Capture Mode)
</b>        Normal ANSI escape sequences are not written to the capture file. The
        sysop can use this command to enable all characters (including ANSI
        escape sequences) to be written.

<b>        LOCK [x]        (Lock Node)
</b>        The sysop can use this command to prevent users logging onto a node
        until the lock is removed. If 'x' is specified, that node's lock
        status will be toggled, otherwise a list of all nodes is given and
        the sysop is prompted for the node to lock or unlock. Sysops and
        users with the 'L' exemption can use this command and log onto locked
        nodes. A locked node will have an 'L' in parenthesis after the node
        information in the node listings.

<b>        INTR [x]        (Interrupt Node)
</b>	This command allows a sysop (or user with the 'I' exemption) to hang up
        on a user on another node. If the user is currently executing an
        external program (editors and transfer protocols included), he will
        not be disconnected until control returns to Synchronet. A message will
        be displayed telling the user that the node has been temporarily closed
        for maintenance before carrier is dropped. If 'x' is specified that
        node's interrupt status will be toggled, otherwise a list of all nodes
        is displayed and the sysop is prompted for the node who's interrupt
        state he wishes to toggle. The current interrupt status of a node is
        reflected by an 'I' in square brackets following the node information
        line in the node listings.

<b>        DOWN [x]        (Down Node)
</b>        A sysop can toggle the down status of a node with this command. When
        a node has the down status (noted by the [D] flag on the node status
        line) it will be shutdown immediately after the user logs off. If a
        user is not online, it will shutdown immediately.

<b>        ANON            (Anonymous)
</b>        This command makes the current node anonymous. Sysops and users with
        the 'Q' exemption have access to this command. To a sysop, an anonymous
        node appears normal with the addition of an 'A' in square brackets
        following the node information line.

<b>        QUIET           (Quiet Mode)
</b>        Using this command, a sysop (or user with the 'Q' exemption) can make
        his node appear to be &quot;Waiting for call&quot; to other users of the system.
        Users with this ability can also make this state their default state
        upon logon in the user defaults section. Local users can logon in
        this state with the WFC command SPACE, then 'Z' or user number 1 can
        logon fast and quiet with the WFC command SPACE, then 'Q'.
        To a sysop, a node in this state appears normal with the addition of
        a 'Q' in square brackets following the node information line.

<b>        RERUN [x]       (Rerun Node)
</b>        This command allows a sysop to rerun any node on the system by
        specifying the node number on the command line. If there is a user
        on the node that is to be rerun, the node will not rerun until that
	user logs off. A node that is going to be rerun is noted with an
        'R' in square brackets following the node information in node listings.

<b>        DOS             (Shell to DOS)
</b>        Using this command, a sysop can go straight to the DOS command line
        locally or remotely. If the sysop is on locally, ALT-D is the
        preferred method of shelling to DOS. If a local sysop wishes to shell
        to DOS from the wait for call screen, he can use the 'D' command.

<b>        EDIT [s]        (Edit Text/MSG File)
</b>        A sysop can edit any ASCII text (and MSG format) files on the system
        with this command. If 's' is given, it will be used as the filename to
        be opened or created if it doesn't exist. If 's' is not specified, the
        filename will be prompted for.

<b>        LOG             (Today's Detail Log)
</b>        A sysop can view today's detailed log file with this command. This
        command views the same file as the 'L' wait for call screen command.

<b>        YLOG            (Yesterday's Detail Log)
</b>        A sysop can view yesterday's detailed log file with this command. This
        command views the same file as the 'Y' wait for call screen command.

<b>        NS [x]          (Node Statistics)
</b>        This command will give today's statistics for node 'x' if specified,
        or the current node.

<b>        SS              (System Statistics)
</b>        This command will give today's statistics for all nodes combined.

<b>        NLOG [x]        (Node Statistics Log)
</b>        A sysop can view the history of statistics information for any node on
        the system. If 'x' is specified, that will be the node who's statistics
        are viewed, otherwise the current node. Same as 'N' from the wait for
        call screen.

<b>        SLOG            (System Statistics Log)
</b>        Using this command, a sysop can view the history of statistics
        information for the system. Same as 'S' from the wait for call screen.

<b>        MEM             (Available Memory)
</b>        This command dispays the amount of memory available to Synchronet and
        any external programs it executes (without swapping).

<b>        LIST [s]        (View Text/MSG File)
</b>        A sysop can use this command to view any ASCII text (or MSG format)
        file on the system. If the filename 's' is not specified, it is
        prompted for.

<b>	GURU		(View Guru Log)
</b>        A sysop can use this command to view the GURU.LOG file which contains
        discussions that users have had with the system guru (GURU.DAT).
        See GURU.DAT for more information.

<b>        MAIL            (Read All Mail)
</b>        Using this command (or 'M' from the WFC screen) a sysop can read all
        the e-mail on the system.

<b>	BULKMAIL	(Send Mass Mailing)
</b>	Use this command to send a single e-mail message to multiple users.

<b>	CALL [Hub-ID]	(Force QWKnet Call-out)
</b>	Forces a QWKnet call-out to the hub &quot;Hub-ID&quot; the next time the call-out
	node is at the WFC screen. Example: CALL VERT

<b>	EXEC [Command]	(Execute a DOS program or Baja module)
</b>	Execute internal DOS commands (DIR, TYPE, etc.) by prepending
	&quot;command /c&quot; to your command line. Execute Baja modules by prepending
	&quot;*&quot; to  the command line. Baja modules must be located in your EXEC
	directory. Command line specifiers (see appendix A) may be used.

<b>	CHAT
</b>	Users with the 'C' exemption can use this command to page the sysop.

<b>        OLD             (Search for Files not Downloaded Since New-Scan Date)
</b>        A sysop can use this command to remove, edit, or move files that were
        uploaded before the new-scan date (set with the '&amp;P' transfer section
        command) and have not been downloaded since.

<b>        OLDUL           (Search for Files Uploaded Before New-Scan Date)
</b>        A sysop can use this command to remove, edit, or move files that were
        uploaded before the new-scan date (set with the '&amp;P' transfer section
        command).

<b>        CLOSE           (Search for Files Currently Open)
</b>        If there are no users online and all nodes are running, there should
        be no file records open. A sysop can check for open file records with
	this command. Any file records that are left open erroneously, can be
        closed with this command. This circumstance should not happen.

<b>        ALTUL [x]       (Alternate File Path Uploads)
</b>        If there are alternate file paths configured, a sysop can use this
        command to set the current upload path to one of the alternate file
        paths. All subsequent upload commands will use the alternate upload
        path as the storage directory regardless of the storage path specified
        for the directory being uploaded to. This is a useful command for
        those who wish to have one directory with files listed from multiple
        CD-ROMs.
        See CD-ROM for more information on creating alternate file paths.

<b>        UPLOAD          (Bulk Local Upload)
</b>        This command searches for files that are on disk, but not in the
        database of the directory. If any are found, a description is prompted
        for and the file is then added to the database.

<b>        RESORT          (Re-Sort and/or Compress)
</b>        A sysop can use this command to re-sort a directory if he has changed
        the sort order in the directory configuration or can use this command
        to remove deleted file records from the database to conserve memory and
        disk space. If there are many deleted files in the database of a
        directory, performance will also be affected. Deleted file records
        are used by new uploaded files, but if a substantial amount of files
        have been removed from a directory, a sysop may wish to use this
        command.

<b>        OFFLINE         (Search for Offline Files)
</b>        This command will search the disk for files that are in the database
        of a directory but not actually on the disk. The sysop can then remove,
        edit, or move these files to another directory. Offline directories
        are ignored in this search.

<b>	DIR [s] 	(Directory of Files)
</b>	This command displays a DOS directory of the path specified. If no
	path is specified, a directory of the current file transfer directory
	is displayed.

<b>	GET [s] 	(Download File From Anywhere)
</b>        A sysop can download a file from any drive or directory on the system
        by using this command. The file does not have to be in the file
        database.

<b>	PUT [s] 	(Upload File to Anywhere)
</b>        A sysop can use this command to upload a file to a local disk without
        having to add it to the file database.</pre>
