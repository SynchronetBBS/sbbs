Notes on building Synchronet on 64-bit systems
==============================================
The 64-bit port is a relatively new effort on the part of the Synchronet
developers.  Since none of the active developers are currently running 64-bit
OSs, progress on this port is relatively slow.  However, the BBS itself and
the scfg utility have been ported to 64-bit and appear to be working correctly.

A few extra steps must be used to get a working build of Synchronet for 64-bit
platforms:
1) /usr/include/inttypes.h MUST exist.
	This is a C99 file which includes stdint.h which defines size-based
	integer types.  Without this file, Synchronet will not know the sizes
	of the integer types and will therefore assume 32-bit hardware.

	If this include file does not exist, you will need to obtain it from
	somewhere or not attempt a 64-bit Synchronet build.

2) The included libraries are not for 64-bit platforms and so must be installed
   using other methods.  The libraries in question are:
	cryptlib - Used for the SSH support
		Available from http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/
	spidermonkey (THREADED) - Used for JavaScript support
		The easiest way to get a threaded spidermonkey is to install
		a native Mozilla browser such as Firefox
	nspr4 - Used by spidermonkey
		Installing a Mozilla browser will also install an nspr4 library
		however, you will also need 64-bit capable nspr4 headers.
		Your platform should have an nspr4 development package
		available which should be installed 
	SDL - *OPTIONAL* - Used by scfg and other console based utilities.
		Available from http://www.libsdl.org/
		This package is not required for building or running anything
		but does allow extra capabilities that other methods do not.

3) Specifying library and include file locations
   Library and header locations can be passed on the make command-line if they
   are not in standard locations (/usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
   /usr/local/lib64, /usr/include, /usr/lib, and /usr/lib64)
	cryptlib:
		Specify the path the the header files using the CRYPTLIBINCLUDE
		macro.
		ex: ``make CRYPTLIBINCLUDE=/usr/local/include/cl''
		Specify the path to the library file using the CRYPTLIBDIR
		macro.
	spidermonkey:
		Specify the NAME of the library (without the lib prefix or any
		file suffixes) using the JSLIB macro.  For Mozilla browsers,
		the library name would be ``moxjs''
		ex: ``make JSLIB=mozjs''
		Specify the path the the library file using the JSLIBDIR macro.
		The include files that come with Synchronet SHOULD work.
		However, if they don't, you can specify the path using the
		JSINCLUDE macro.
	nspr4:
		Specify the path to the library using the NSPRDIR macro and
		the path to the include files using the NSPRINCLUDE macro.
	SDL:
		Specify the complete path to the sdl-config program using the
		SDL_CONFIG macro.
		ex: ``make SDL_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/sdl-config''

4) When reporting bugs, be SURE to mention that you are running a 64-bit build
   and be prepared to follow instructions which may involve debugging and the
   use of core files.  Be absolutely sure to configure your system to save core
   files in the event of a crash of Synchronet.
