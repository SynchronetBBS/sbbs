Technical Support</i></font>

<h3>Support is on a Voluntary Basis</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as <a href=http://www.synchro.net>Synchronet</a> is developed by volunteers, it is supported by volunteers.</p>
<p>No one is obligated to help anyone else with Synchronet. However, Synchronet 
sysops, users, and (especially) its developers, are usually very interested (and often feel 
compelled) in helping 
other sysops, users, and developers understand and overcome technical issues, of all kinds, related to 
Synchronet. These <i>&quot;support-givers&quot;</i> are strictly volunteers, spontaneously giving of their 
free time, to help others enjoy Synchronet as much as possible.</p>
<p>The primary Synchronet <i>support-giver </i>is also the primary developer and 
author of this document, <a href="http://synchro.net/author.html">Rob Swindell</a> 
(AKA <i>digital man</i>). Generally speaking, the information provided by me can 
be trusted to be the most accurate and researched. I do my best to provide 
complete and accurate answers to questions, and no one is more intimate with the 
inner-workings of Synchronet than I. However, I discourage direct e-mail support 
as we want others to be able to learn from the questions and experiences of 
others, as well as give an opportunity for other Synchronet <i>support-givers</i> 
to field questions as much as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Where to Find Support</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Documentation (RTFM)</b><br>
  If you already have Synchronet 
installed, then read the files or perform a text search in the Synchronet <tt>
  <a href="http://wwww.synchro.net/docs/">docs</a></tt> directory.
  The <a href="http://www.synchro.net/">official web-site</a> also includes the documentation files and <b>is</b> searchable online (thanks to <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a>).
  <br>
  <br>
  If you 
  haven't already, read the <a href="http://synchro.net/docs/sysop.html">HTML 
  Sysop Documentation</a>. It is somewhat out-dated at this time (updated as of 
  v3.00c-Win32), but still 
  contains most of the relevant information needed to configure and run a 
  Synchronet v3 BBS. <br>
  <br>
  Read the <a href="http://synchro.net/answers.html">answers</a> to frequently 
  asked questions (FAQs).<br>
  <br>
  Many Synchronet documents were written by different people at different 
  times during the 10-year history of Synchronet and are of a different style 
  and quality.<br>
  <br>
  If you have trouble understanding a portion of a document, try reading the 
  rest of the document to put it in context, or re-read the portion out-loud to 
  yourself, a friend, or family member (which forces you to slow down your 
  reading, hopefully).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Discussion Groups<br>
  </b>There are a number of Synchronet-related discussion groups that are very 
  active and you can anticipate a response quickly.<br>
  They include:<br>
  <br><ul><tt>
	<li><a href="news:alt.bbs.synchronet">USENET</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alt.bbs.synchronet<li><a href="dove-net.txt">DOVE-Net</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://vert.synchro.net/msgs/msgs.ssjs?msg_sub=sync">Synchronet Discussion</a>, Synchronet Sysops, and <a href="http://vert.synchro.net/msgs/msgs.ssjs?msg_sub=syncprog">Synchronet Programming</a><br>
  	<li><a href="http://www.fidonet.org/">FidoNet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SYNCHRONET, SYNC_SYSOPS, and SYNC_PROGRAMMING<br>
  	<li><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synchronet/">Yahoo! 
  Group</a> Synchronet BBS Discussion Group</tt></ul><br>
  Before posting a message on one of these discussion groups, it is expected 
  that you will first search through the previously posted messages for messages 
  related to the issue you have questions about. Your question may have already 
  been answered recently. Several times even.<br>
  <br>
  If you post a message, it is expected that you will read any replies to your 
  message and post a reply with answers to any follow-up questions from <i>
  support-givers</i> or the results of any suggested actions by <i>
  support-givers</i>. More details about the recommended content of your message 
  will follow later in this document.<br>
  <br>
  You can access the main Synchronet support discussion groups, that are gated 
  between DOVE-Net, USENET, and FidoNet, on <i>Vertrauen</i> via
  <a href="http://vert.synchro.net/msgs/subs.ssjs?msg_grp=DOVE-Net">HTTP</a>,
  <a href="news://vert.synchro.net/">NNTP</a>,
  <a href="telnet://vert.synchro.net">Telnet</a>, or
  <a href="gopher://vert.synchro.net">Gopher</a>. You will need to create and 
  login with a valid user account (e.g. not Guest/Anonymous) in order to post 
  messages.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Real-time Chat / Instant Messaging<br>
  </b>
  Unfortunately, there is no permanent record of the support given in Internet Relay Chat (IRC) or 
  Instant Messaging (IM), so there is little chance of anyone else benefiting from 
  the support given there. Also, you have to consider yourself lucky to find a 
  knowledgeable <i>support-giver</i> available for chat at the exact time you 
  need help. For these reasons, it is preferred that you use a <b>discussion group</b>
  for support questions.<br>
  <br>
  Synchronet Inter-BBS Instant Messaging technology is in its infancy at this 
  time and requires direct real-time one-on-one communication between you and a
  <i>support-giver </i>of your choosing using a fairly cumbersome user 
  interface. It's best to not use Synchronet's IM technology for technical 
  support at this time. Synchronet <i>support-givers</i> are  generally 
  not reachable using other Instant Message technologies.<br>
  <br>
  The best place to find instant answers to questions is in the <tt>#bbs</tt> or <tt>#synchronet</tt> 
  channels on the BBSnet IRC server: <tt>irc.thebbs.org:6667</tt> or the new 
  Synchronet IRC network at <tt>irc.synchro.net:6667</tt>.<br>

<h3>How to Ask Questions</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Be polite.</b><br>
  Remember, we're just volunteers, so be nice. Don't be demanding, rude, 
  hostile, or 
  inconsiderate.<br>
  This isn't to say we require excessive use of &quot;please and thank you&quot;, just 
  don't abuse us.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Use proper spelling and grammar.<br>
  </b>I (and most, if not all, Synchronet <i>support-givers</i>) speak English 
  and unfortunately, only English. If you do not have command of the English 
  language, please do your best to learn from previous questions/answers from 
  others before posting a message that will likely be difficult for <i>
  support-givers</i> to 
  comprehend.<br>
  <br>
  Many people don't find it necessary to type messages in complete sentences or use 
  proper punctuation, but that can make it difficult for a reader to understand 
  exactly what you're asking. If getting a complete and accurate answer is 
  important to you, don't be lazy when typing your question. Example: Questions 
  should end in a question-mark (?).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Don't be emotional.<br>
  </b>There is no point to starting off a question by explaining how frustrated 
  or pissed-off you are, or explaining how helpless you feel. The issue is (or 
  had better be) a technical one, not an emotional one, so it's best to just 
  leave emotions out of it completely.<br>
  If you feel the necessity to express emotion, use common emoticons. :-)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>No threats.<br>
  </b>Threatening to shut-down your BBS or delete the software
  (&quot;<tt>rm -rf sbbs</tt>&quot;)
  if you don't receive immediate help with some problem is <b>less</b> likely to motivate Synchronet
  <i>support-givers</i> than simply describing the problem in detail.<br><br>
  Synchronet <i>support-givers</i> are generally much more interested in solving a real
  technical problem than they are worried about making sure Synchronet continues to
  consume disk space and CPU cycles for some whiny system operator.
<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Be patient.<br>
  </b>Remember that this is a hobby for us too and we may not read or reply to 
  messages right away, for a variety of reasons. There is no point expressing 
  how &quot;urgent&quot;, &quot;critical&quot;,&nbsp; or &quot;important&quot; your question or problem is; we 
  reply to all messages when we read them and have an answer or follow-up 
  question of relevance. Sometimes networked discussion groups do not work 100% 
  correctly, a message is dropped or held in a queue for an excessive period of 
  time. If you do not get a reply to your message within 5-7 days, post the same 
  message again, perhaps adding a comment explaining that you have not seen a 
  reply. If you don't get a reply within 5-7 days after that, try posting the 
  same message in a different Synchronet-related discussion group. You will get 
  an answer.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Give complete, detailed information.<br>
  </b>If you're getting an error message of any kind,  post the exact, 
  complete error message from a screen capture, or copy/paste from a log 
  file (e.g. <tt>data/error.log</tt>). Don't forget to edit-out any passwords or 
  other sensitive information from logs or screen captures.<br>
  <br>
  Include the frequency of the problem (e.g. only once, every time, 
  intermittently).<br>
  <br>
  The exact steps required to reproduce a problem can be extremely helpful in 
  finding the root cause/solution to a problem.<br>
  <br>
  Specify what version and revision of Synchronet you're running (e.g. 
  &quot;v3.10L-win32&quot;). It is often helpful to know what operating system version 
  and/or distribution you're using (e.g. &quot;Windows XP Pro&quot; or &quot;RedHat Linux 9&quot;).
  <br>
  <br>
  Details about your computer (brand, model, CPU type, speed, hard disk or RAM 
  size) are rarely useful in determining the cause of any Synchronet-related 
  problem. These details are best left out unless specifically asked for by a <i>
  support-giver</i>.<br>
  <br>
  The more complete the information you provide in your initial question, the 
  more likely you are to get a complete and accurate answer to your question 
  without requiring follow-up questions/answers.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Stay on-topic.<br>
  </b>Try to keep your questions to one issue per message thread/topic/subject. This makes it easier 
  to follow-up on later and keep the thread focused on solving one particular 
  issue. <br>
  <br>
  Post any follow-up messages by replying to your original message or a 
  reply from a <i>support-giver</i> (i.e. do not start a new topic for a 
  follow-up message). Do not change the message subject when replying to a 
  support message.<br>
  <br>
  Please do not mix &quot;suggestions&quot; with &quot;support questions&quot;, if you can help it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Answer any follow-up questions asked of you.<br>
  </b>This may be the most important suggestion I can make. When a <i>
  support-giver</i> replies to your message with one or more questions, <b>
  answer</b> <b>each</b> and <b>every</b> question <b>completely</b>. Nothing 
  frustrates me more than trying to help someone that has no problem asking 
  questions but will not answer any questions asked of them.<br>
  <br>
  Quote the pertinent parts of previous messages when replying. (i.e. when 
  posting an answer to a question, be sure to quote the original question as 
  well).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Share the final results for others to learn from.<br>
  </b>When you've taken any recommend actions, don't forget to post a follow-up 
  message with the results of those actions.<br>
  If you see someone else asking the same question later, don't hesitate to 
  become a <i>support-giver</i> yourself and tell them of any solutions or 
  results you've encountered yourself.<br>

<h3>Examples of Bad Support Questions</h3>
<p>&quot;hey man my bbs took a crap again.&quot;</p>

<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>
Thank you for taking the time to read this document. And thanks in advance for taking
into consideration the recommendations made here for getting good technical suport in the future.
As a nod to <i>support-givers</i>, include a &quot;Huzzah!&quot; in support messages (subject or body).
This single word will let us know that you've read this document and agree to the principles
out-lined here, and it just might give your support question a little boost in priority
(no promises). For those who haven't bothered to read this document, let them wonder aloud
what this secret handshake is all about. ;-)
