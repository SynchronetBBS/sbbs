<h2><a name="UsingUserEditLocally">[6.1] - Using User Edit Locally&nbsp;</a></h2>

<pre><b>Graphical Synchronet User Editor <i><font color="#FF0000">(v3+ Only)</font></i></b></pre>
<pre>The User Editor application can be executed from the menu bar of the Synchronet 
Control Panel as shown below.

<img border="0" src="images/uedit_v3_exe.png" width="430" height="151"></pre>
<pre>Below is a screenshot of the GUI User Editor with a sample user and data
shown.  How this screen looks will vary depending upon your configuration
and what data you decide to collect from new users. There are many options
and settings available in the User Editor and you should spend some time
getting familiar with this feature.</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/uedit_v3.png" width="453" height="403"></pre>
<pre><b>Online Synchronet User Editor</b>

<b>Alt-U   <i><font color="#FF0000">(v2 Only)</font></i></b>
	The sysop can locally hit Alt-U at any time within Synchronet to bring
        up the User Edit function with the user that is online as the current
        user to edit. After exiting User Edit, the sysop will return to the
        place where he was prior to hitting Alt-U. </pre>
<pre><b>U</b>
	At the Reading Mail or Reading All Mail prompts, hitting 'U' will pop
	the sysop into User Edit with the author of the previous message as the
	current user. Hitting 'U' at the Waiting for call screen will start
	User Edit. Hitting 'U' from the Reading Messages (O)perator menu will
	start User Edit too.

<b>;UEDIT
</b>        Typing ';UEDIT' at either the Main or Transfer prompts will also pop
	the sysop into User Edit and if a user number or name is specified
	(e.g. ;UEDIT 20 or ;UEDIT BOB), then that user will be the current
	user.</pre>
<h2><a name="UsingUserEditRemotely">[6.2] - Using User Edit Remotely</a></h2>
<pre>When a remote sysop initiates User Edit (with the U or ;UEDIT command), User
Edit functions a little differently than when a local sysop initiates it.
A remote sysop cannot raise any user's Level above his own and can't give a
user any Flags or Exemptions that he/she doesn't have. A remote sysop can not
edit any information of any users with a Level higher than his own and their
passwords, real names, and phone numbers aren't displayed to him/her.

The available commands are listed below with explanations.

<b>A - Alias and Chat Handle:
</b>        This command will let you edit the user's alias - a 25 character field
        that must start with a non numeric character. You can also edit the
        user's chat handle (an 8 character field) with this command.

<b>B - Birthday
</b>        You can edit the user's birthday with this command. The form of the
        date is forced as either MM/DD/YY or DD/MM/YY (depending on the
        setting of the European date option).

<b>C - Computer Description:
</b>        You can edit the user's 30 character computer description field with
        this command.

<b>D - Delete/Deactivate/Restore/Activate:
</b>        If the current user is at normal status (not deleted or inactive),
        hitting this command will prompt you if you wish to delete or
        inactivate this user. If you delete a user, his account will be saved
        for number of days since his last logon. This number of days is
        specified by the sysop in the SCFG. After this number of days,
        a new user may obtain this slot. Inactive slots are the same as deleted
        ones, except that they are reserved and can't be used by new users.
 
        If the current user is deleted or inactive (as specified by the 1st
        line of the screen), this command will allow you to restore the user
        to normal status.

<b>E - Exemption Flags:</b>
        Exemptions are used by the sysop to give user's extended privilege
        to the system. For example, you might want to give a trustworthy
        user the right to remove, move, and edit descriptions of all files
        in the Transfer Section. Normally users can only remove or edit the
        description of a file they've uploaded, but a user with the 'R'
        exemption can move any file, remove any file, or edit any file
        description in the Transfer Section. This ability is normally only
        given to sysops.

        Using this command you can toggle the state of an Exemption Flag
        by hitting the corresponding letter. To view a menu of the available
        exemptions, hit '?' or [ENTER] to stop editing the Exemption Flags.

        The following is a list of the available exemptions and their
        descriptions ($ indicates that sysops have this capability):

<b>        A - Anonymous
</b>                Allows user to post and send e-mail anonymously.
<b>        C - Chat $
</b>                Allows user to page the local sysop with the ;CHAT command
                regardless of the sysop availability state (Scroll-Lock).
<b>        D - Download
</b>                Allows user to download files even when the user doesn't
                have enough credits.
<b>	E - Expire by Time
</b>		Prevents user account from expiring when the user runs out of
		time and the SCFG-&gt;System-&gt;Toggle Options-&gt;User Expires When
		Out of Time is set to YES.
<b>        F - FidoNet Crash/File Request/Return Receipt NetMail
</b>                Allows user to send NetMail using title specifiers:
                &quot;CR:&quot; to over-ride default crash status to ON
                &quot;FR:&quot; to send file requests (FREQ)
		&quot;FA:&quot; to send file attachments
                &quot;RR:&quot; to request a return receipt
                See Sending FidoNet NetMail for more information.
<b>        G - Multiple Nodes $
</b>                Allows user to be logged on to more than one node at a time.
                This exemption is useful for Guest accounts.
<b>        H - No inactivity
</b>                Allows user to be logged for extended inactive periods
                without being automatically disconnected.
<b>        I - Interrupt Nodes $
</b>		Allows user to interrupt (hang up on) other nodes with the
                ;INTR command.
<b>        J - Chat Channel Cost
</b>                User will not be charged credits to change chat channels.
<b>        L - Logons per day
</b>                Allows user to logon the system an indefinite number of times
                per day.
<b>        M - Modem Rate $
</b>                Allows user to logon any node at any modem speed regardless
                of what the minimum modem speed for that node is.
<b>        N - Node Locking $
</b>                Allows user to toggle the lock status of any node with the
                ;LOCK command and log on a locked node.
<b>        P - Permanent
</b>                This user account will not be automatically deleted because
                of inactivity.
<b>        Q - Quiet/Anonymous Node $
</b>		Allows user to toggle the quiet or anonymous state of his node
                with the ;QUIET or ;ANON commands respectively. Nodes that are
                in quiet mode appear to be &quot;Waiting for call&quot; to the other
                nodes. Anonymous modes appear to have &quot;UNKNOWN USER&quot; online.
<b>        R - Remove/Move/Edit Descriptions of Files $
</b>                Allows user to remove, move, or edit the descriptions of any
                file in the Transfer Section that the user has access to.
<b>        S - Send NetMail Cost
</b>                User will not be charge credits for sending NetMail.
<b>        T - Time Online
</b>                Allows the user to remain online indefinitely - no time limit.
                The inactivity timer remains active.
<b>        X - External Programs
</b>                User will not be charged credits to run external.

<b>F - Flags:
</b>        This command lets you toggle the state of all Flags. Hitting a number
        will allow you to edit that particular flag set. Hitting '?' will
        display a menu that is used to remind the sysop of the meaning of each
        Flag. These menus are located in the TEXT\MENU directory and names are
        FLAGS1.ASC, FLAGS2.ASC, FLAGS3.ASC, and FLAGS4.ASC. Hitting [ENTER]
        will end the editing of the flags.

        The Flags in conjunction with the Level can by used by the sysop to
        limit access to Message Groups, Sub-boards, External Programs,
        General Text File Sections, Transfer Libraries, and Directories.

<b>G - Go to a User:
</b>        This command will let you change the current user into another user
        by entering the user's name, partial name, or number. It should be
        noted that the fastest way to change the current user is to type the
        number of the user directly at the User Edit prompt.

<b>H - Edit/Create Extended Comment:
</b>        This command will let the sysop edit or view an existing extended
        comment or create a new one. An extended comment is a free-form message
        file that a sysop creates that contains information pertaining to this
        user. A '+' after the &quot;Comment:&quot; string on the 5th line of the User
        Edit screen specifies that an extended comment already exists.

<b>I - Inspect or Edit User's Default Settings:
</b>        This command will bring up the current user's default settings for
        ANSI terminal emulation, screen length, screen pausing, spinning
        cursor, auto new file scan, clear screen after messages, auto menu
        display, and default QUIET mode (if the user has the 'Q' exemption).

<b>J - Edit Minutes:
</b>        This command allows the sysop to edit the current user's minute field.

<b>K - Edit Date Fields:
</b>        The command will let you edit the date fields for this user's last
        logon, first logon, expiration date, and password modification date.
        All dates are forced to the form MM/DD/YY or DD/MM/YY if European
        date format is enabled.

<b>L - Location:
</b>        This command will allow the sysop to edit the user's address, location,
        and zip/postal code fields.

<b>M - Security Level:
</b>        The sysop can edit the user's Security Level with this command. The
        user's Level is a decimal number in the range 0 to 99. Higher levels
        indicate higher access. Users with a level of 90 or higher are
        considered to be sysops. The sysop can use the Level in conjunction
        with the Flags to limit access to Message Groups, Sub-boards, General
        Text File Sections, External Programs, Transfer Libraries, and
        Directories. The Level also determines the user's maximum time online
        per day, per call, maximum logons per day, and maximum number of lines
        per message (post or e-mail).

<b>N - Note/Name:
</b>        If aliases are allowed on the system, this command will allow the sysop
        to edit the user's public note. This field is displayed next to the
        user's alias in user listings and the logon list.

        If aliases are not allowed, this command allows the sysop to edit the
        user's name. The user's name is a 30 character field that must begin
        with a printable non-numeric character. The first letter of each word
        in the user's name is forced uppercase.

<b>O - Sysop Comment:
</b>        This command allows the sysop to edit the private 60 character comment
        field regarding this user.

<b>P - Phone Number:</b>
        The sysop can edit the user's phone number.

<b>Q - Quit User Edit:
</b>        Exits the User Edit function and returns the sysop to where he was
        prior to initiating User Edit.

<b>R - Real Name (if aliases are allowed):
</b>        This command allows the sysop to edit the user's real name - a 25
        character field. The first letter of each word in this field is forced
        uppercase.

<b>S - Sex:
</b>        A single uppercase character is used to describe the sex of the user
        (normally 'M' or 'F'), but can be changed to any uppercase character
        with this command.

<b>T - Set Text Search String:
</b>        Use this command to set the text string to search for (using the {
        and } commands).

<b>U - Upload/Download Statistics:
</b>        The sysop can edit the user's upload and download statistics with
        this command. The statistics are the number of bytes and files uploaded
        and the number of bytes and files downloaded. These are numeric fields.

<b>V - Quick-Validate User:
</b>        This command will display the ten quick-validation sets (0 to 9)
        for quickly setting the user's Security Level, Flags, Exemptions,
        Restrictions, Expiration Date, and/or Credits. The Quick-Validation
        sets are set by the sysop in SCFG-&gt;System-&gt;Quick-Validation Values.

<b>W - Password:
</b>        Use this command to change the user's password. The password
        modification date doesn't change when using this command (use 'K'
        to change the password modification date).

<b>X - View Extended Comment:
</b>        This command allows the sysop to the user's extended comment if it
        exists.

<b>Y - Copy User to Another Slot:
</b>        This command will copy the user data of the current slot to another
        valid slot. This will overwrite any user information in the
        destination slot.

<b>Z - Restriction Flags:
</b>        A sysop can give a user restrictions from certain sections or features
        of the BBS by setting one or more valid Restriction Flags. Typing the
        letter of a restriction will toggle its status, '?' will display a menu
        of the valid restrictions and [ENTER] will end the flag editing
        procedure. The valid restrictions and their descriptions follow:

<b>        A - ANSI and Ctrl-A Codes
</b>                User can't write messages containing either ANSI escape
                sequences or Ctrl-A attribute codes.

                This restriction automatically puts the user at the QWK prompt
                upon logon and no other sections of the BBS are accessible.
                This restriction also allows the user to upload REP packets
                containing messages that are from users other than the current
                user.
<b>        R - Remove/Edit Descriptions of Files
</b>                User can't remove or edit file descriptions of files he has
                uploaded.
<b>        S - E-mail Sysop
</b>                User can't send e-mail (feedback) to user #1.
<b>        T - Transfer Section
</b>                User can't access the Transfer Section at all.
<b>        U - Upload
</b>                User cannot upload files to the Transfer Section.
<b>        W - Auto-message
</b>                User cannot write to auto-message.
<b>        X - External Programs
</b>                User can't access the external program menu ('X' from Main
                Menu).
<b>        Y - Are you sure (y/N) ?
</b>                The user will be forced to answer Yes prior to performing
                any function from the Main or Transfer Sections.

<b>] - Move Up One User Slot:
</b>        Increment the current user number by one. If the current user is
        the last user, the current user will become user number 1 (wrap).

<b>[ - Move Down One User Slot:
</b>        Decrement the current user number by one. If the current user is
        the first user, the current user will become the last user (wrap).

<b>(Number) - Change to User Number:
</b>        Entering a user number directly at the User Edit command prompt will
        make that user the current user.

<b>/ - Set Search String:
</b>        Use this command to set the AR string to search for (using the { and
	} commands). See the ARS Security chapter for explanation of AR string.

<b>} - Search Forward:
</b>        Searches from the current user to the last user for the string set by
	the '/' (ARS) or 'T' (text) command.

<b>{ - Search Backward:
</b>        Searches from the current user to the first user for the string set by
	the '/' (ARS) or 'T' (text) command.

<b>~ - Set Leech Download Counter:
</b>        Every time a user downloads a file and the BBS detects the possible
        use of a 'leech' protocol, a counter is incremented and the value is
        displayed on the Downloaded Bytes and Files line if it is not zero. To
        change the value of this counter, use the '~' command.

<b>+ - Add or Subtract Credits:
</b>        This command will let you add or subtract credits to/from a user's
        account. Putting an 'M' after the number will multiply the amount by
        one megabyte (1,048,576) or a 'K' will multiply the amount by one
        kilobyte (1024). Placing a '$' will multiply with the number by the
        number of credits per dollar in the current system configuration.
        Placing a minus sign before the number will perform a subtraction of
        credits.

<b>* - Add or Subtract Minutes:
</b>        This command will let you add or subtract time from the user's minute
        field. Putting an 'H' after the number will multiply the amount by 60
        minutes (an hour). Placing a minus sign before the number will perform
        a subtraction of minutes.

<b>$ - Edit Credits:
</b>        This command allows you to edit the amount of credits of the current
        user.

<b># - View SIF Questionnaire:
</b>        If the sysop has specified a SIF questionnaire in the SCFG and the
        current user has answered the questionnaire, this command will allow
        the sysop to view the answered questionnaire. An output SIF (usually
        an abbreviation of the input SIF) will be used if specified in the
        SCFG, if not specified the output SIF will be used for viewing.</pre>
