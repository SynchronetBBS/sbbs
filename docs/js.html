<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">JavaScript is an
established, mature scripting language syntactically similar to C++ and Java.<b><br>
JavaScript is</b> <b>not Java</b>. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The ECMA and ISO standards
organizations have standardized the core JavaScript language in <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/javascript/e262-pdf.pdf">ECMA-262</a>
(ECMAScript) and ISO-16262.<o:p>

<h2><span style="font-family: Arial">Baja and JavaScript</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><a href="baja.html">Baja</a> is the original
programming language of Synchronet (introduced in v2.0), used to create
Synchronet-specific <i>modules</i> and <i>command shells</i>. Baja was
originally designed as a simple BASIC-like language for controlling the display
of menus and command prompts, accepting commands from the user and passing on
control to high-level BBS functions. Over the years, Baja has been extended and
enhanced to allow a high-level of functionality, but it was never going to reach
the power and flexibility of JavaScript.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For example Baja modules and command shells,
see the <b><samp>.src</samp></b> files in your Synchronet <b><code>exec</code></b> directory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For the foreseeable future Baja modules and
command-shells will continue to be supported in Synchronet, but sysops and
developers are encouraged to use JavaScript instead of Baja moving forward. With
very few exceptions, everything that can be done in a Baja module can be done in
a JavaScript module, and much much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Eventually, all the stock command-shells and
external modules will be converted to JavaScript.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Arial">JavaScript Files</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">JavaScript files are just ASCII text files.
They are normally named with a <b><code>.js</code></b> file extension and located in your
Synchronet <b><samp>exec</samp></b> directory. JavaScript files do not need to be compiled.
JavaScript files are loaded into memory at the time of execution, so a change to
a JavaScript file will take effect the next time that file is executed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For example JavaScript modules and services,
see the <b><samp>.js</samp></b> files in your Synchronet <b><code>exec</code></b> directory.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Arial">Integration</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">At this time (v3.10j beta), JavaScript files
can be executed from:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Telnet/Rlogin Server</b>&nbsp;<br>
 as a timed event, external program (door), login/logon/newuser module,<br>
    basically anywhere a Baja module or executable can be launched</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>FTP Server</b><br>
    dynamically generates HTML index files<br>
    see <samp>exec/ftp-html.js</samp></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Services</b><br>
    all services at this time (both static and dynamic) are written in
    JavaScript<br>
    see <samp>exec/*service.js</samp> and <samp>ctrl/services.cfg</samp></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">From the Telnet/Rlogin server, a JavaScript file is executed on a native command-line
by placing a question mark (<samp>?</samp>) at the beginning of the command-line
before the JavaScript file name (in SCFG). It is not necessary to specify the <b><samp>.js</samp></b>
portion of the file name on the command-line. For example, the command-line to execute
the file <tt>exec/newslink.js</tt> would be &quot;<tt>?newslink</tt>&quot;.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: Arial">Object Model</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Synchronet has its own JavaScript object
model, not to be confused with the Document Object Model (DOM) used in web
browsers. In order to fully understand the capabilities of JavaScript modules in
Synchronet, you must familiarize yourself with <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/library/manuals/2000/javascript/1.5/reference/">Core
JavaScript</a> as well as the <a href="jsobjs.html">Synchronet JavaScript Object
Model</a>.</span></p>
