<h1 align=center>What's New in Synchronet v3.13</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>All Servers</b><ul>
	<li>Overhaul of temporary directory usage:<br><ul>
		<li>No more temp files in <tt>data</tt> or <tt>data/temp</tt><br>
			<tt>ctrl/../temp</tt> (e.g. <tt>sbbs/temp</tt>) is the new default location for temporary files
		<li>Each server has its own separately configurable temp dir (in <tt>ctrl/sbbs.ini</tt>)
		<li>BBS events (e.g. QWK packet processing) now have their own exclusive-use
			temp dir (e.g. <tt>sbbs/temp/event</tt>)
		<li>All server threads will attempt to create and verify the validity of their temp dir
		<li>The system temp directory is only used as the default temp dir for Unix (i.e. <tt>/tmp</tt>)<br>
			since the Windows default temp dir (e.g. <tt>C:\DOCUME~1\Rob\LOCALS~1\Temp</tt>) is not
			particularly friendly or attractive
		</ul>
	<li>The startup/initialization file may now be named:<br>
		<tt>ctrl/sbbs<i>[.host | .platform]</i>.ini</tt> or <tt>ctrl/startup<i>[.host | .platform]</i>.ini</tt>
	<li>New bool ARS keywords (convenience shorthand):<ul>
		<li><tt>GUEST</tt> (shorthand for "<tt>REST G</tt>")
		<li><tt>QNODE</tt> (shorthand for "<tt>REST Q</tt>")
		</ul>
	</ul><br>
<li><b>Web Server</b><ul>
	<li>Win32-CGI support (tested with <tt>php-cgi.exe</tt>)
	<li>Created <tt>ctrl/cgi_env.ini</tt> which dictates which system environment variables
	will be passed to CGI processes and which default or forced values they will have
	<li>Default CGI content-type is now configurable via <tt>sbbs.ini [web] DefaultCGIContent</tt><br>
		(defaults to "<tt>text/plain</tt>")
	<li>Added CGI environment variable <tt>REDIRECT_STATUS=200</tt> for PHP-CGI kludge (thx Deuce)
	<li>Added non-standard (Apache) <tt>SCRIPT_FILENAME</tt> environment variable required by PHP-CGI
	<li>Bug-fix: default server-side JavaScript file extension (".ssjs", not "ssjs")
	<li>Bug-fix: removed ":port" specification from vhost paths
	<li>When logging and using virtual hosts, log every virtual host in it's own
		separate file in the format: <tt>(prefix)vhostname-date.log</tt>
	<li>Renamed <tt>sbbs.ini [web] CgiTempDirectory</tt> to just <tt>TempDirectory</tt><br>
		(this directory is actually used for SSJS, not CGI)
	<li>Work-around: change current directory to <tt>ctrl</tt> directory during initialization
		<br>Deuce's .ssjs files
		make assumptions about the current working directory when opening files
	<li>Created global JS variables: <i>web_root_dir</i> and <i>web_error_dir</i><br>
		to be used in the
		future instead of assuming that <tt>"../web/.."</tt> will be the correct location of a
		specific file
	<li>Created global JS <i>log()</i> function (like all good servers should have)
	<li>JS <i>print()</i> is an alias for <i>writeln()</i>
	<li>Bug-fix: JS <i>write()</i> and <i>writeln()</i> methods must return string written
		as other servers' implementations do
	<li>Add support for streaming-style <tt>.ssjs</tt> files<br>If you set <i>http_reply.fast</i> to
		<i>true</i> BEFORE the first <i>write()</i>, the first write will send the headers and
		every write will go through the socket immediately<br>
		This will make large 
		<tt>.ssjs</tt> files appear to be faster (e.g. Large user lists)
	<li>CGI scripts now have STDIN directly from the socket. File uploads should
		work again now
	<li>If a CGI script sends the LENGTH header, turn keep-alives on
	<li>New <tt>formmail.ssjs</tt> script to emulate Matt Wright's <tt>FormMail.pl</tt> script
	<li>New <tt>404.ssjs</tt> file to display directory contents
		[<a href=http://vert.synchro.net/Synchronet>example</a>]
	<li>Bug-fix: numerous memory leaks were present due to things being allocated, and structures being
		zeroed every time through the redirect loop instead of per-request
	<li>Added external web-content handler support using <tt>ctrl/web_handler.ini</tt><br>
		This should allow for competing dynamic HTML solutions based on server-side
		JavaScript (e.g. <tt>.xjs</tt>).<br>
		Tip: use <i>http_request.real_path</i> for the path to file-to-be-parsed<br>
		This should also allow <tt>php-cgi.exe</tt> (for example) to automatically handle <tt>.php</tt> files
	<li>Bug-fix: when logging failed login attempts, was logging wrong password variable (i.e. garbage)
	</ul><br>
<li><b>Mail Server</b><ul>
	<li>Bug-fixes: Numerous External Mail Processor (<tt>mailproc.ini</tt>) related problems
	<li>Set the "reply-to" header field on outbound mail if the local sender has their account configured to
		forward received mail to a valid netmail address
	<li>SMTP <tt>RCPT TO</tt> command now fails if no recipient specified
	<li>Represent FidoNet addresses in "From:" header fields using <tt>"name" &lt;ftn_addr&gt;</tt>
		notation (for Deuce)
	<li>Bug-fix: send "EHLO" (instead of "HELO") for SMTP relay attempts using SMTP authentication (which requires
		the ESMTP extensions implied by the "EHLO" command)
	<li>Bug-fix: handle received multiple-hop (routed) QWK netmail correctly
	<li>If sending to a domain your system handles (i.e. system inetaddr, host name
		or an entry in <tt>ctrl/domains.cfg</tt>), connect to the local SMTP server, by interface IP if server is  
		bound to a specific IP, or "127.0.0.1" if it is not
	<li>Reject (don't attempt to send to) MX records that resolve to <tt>127.x.x.x</tt><br>
		(e.g. <tt>sbcglobel.net</tt> [sic])
	<li>Bug-fix: handles attachments of multiple files specified in subject<br>
		(typically FTN netmail messages)
	</ul><br>
<li><b>FTP Server</b><ul>
	<li>Now supports configurable IP address to use in PASV responses
		(for broken firewall/NAT devices) and PASV port ranges (default is 1024-65535)<br>
		See the <a href="tcpip_faq.html#ftp_nat">TCP/IP FAQ</a> for more details
	<li>Added kludge required to work-around SMC Barricade router "P@SW" bug
	<li>Bug-fix: not allowing simultaneous downloads of the same file
	<li>Support "LIST -opts" command in local file system mode
	<li>Create tempory transfer files in the (*gasp*) temporary directory (instead of data directory)
	<li>Use more unique temporary transfer filenames (includes the local hostname)
	<li>If an aliased file or directory has a description of "hidden", don't display it
		in directory listings
	<li>Created <tt>exec/ftp-web-html.js</tt> for sysops running the Synchronet Web Server<br>
		Uses HTTP for CSS and image files. Edit <tt>ctrl/sbbs.ini</tt> to use <tt>ftp-web-html.js</tt> instead of
		the default <tt>ftp-html.js</tt>
	</ul><br>
<li><b>Telnet/RLogin Server</b><ul>
	<li>Bug-fix: the Win32 list long filename feature didn't work correctly with filenames with
		a less than 8 character base name
	<li>Bug-fix: if a file with a long filename was blind uploaded
		(e.g. with <i>SEXYZ</i> or <i>rz</i>), then it would not be properly added to the database<br>
		(but the file would be copied to the destination directory)
	<li>Bug-fix: moving a file between directories would use the Micros~1 shortened version of the filename
	<li>When uploading a file, if no description is given, use the filename
		(rather than "No description given")<br> if the real filename is different than
		the one in the database (e.g. it's a long filename)
	<li>Now passes QWKnet hub name as <tt>%s</tt> on QWKnet call-out command-line
	<li>Bug-fix: qnet-ftp will only delete the .REP packet if it was sent successfully
	<li>Delete/ignore the file ATTXREF.DAT if included in .REP packets
	<li>Ignore the "Your Messages Only" scan configuration flag for QWKnet accounts
	<li>Don't ask "Your Messages Only?" during scan configuration for QWKnet accounts
	<li>Bug-fix: when answering 'No' to the "Use an external text editor?" new user question, it would
		not force the editor to the internal line editor
	<li>Bug-fix: hitting 'Q' from the external editor selection dialog,
		the current editor would be changed anyway
	<li>Bug-fix: allow control keys (e.g. Ctrl-U) to have effect while waiting for paged node to respond
	<li>Bug-fix: buffer overflow (segfault) in temporary directory file extraction/transfer section
	<li>Subtle Bug-fix: when executing a native external program, the server process's
		environment is no longer modified to set variables in the spawned process's
		environment. This could result in a race condition where if multinodes executed
		native externals simultaneously, one node's child process could get the wrong
		node number (SBBSNNUM) or node directory (SBBSNODE) value (in theory).<br>
		This Bug-fix only applies to Win32 builds only
	<li>Changed parsing of DSZLOG (<tt>protocol.log</tt>) to account for long filenames and
		filenames with spaces in them
	<li>Fix ups for new user creation via RLogin (Deuce)
	<li>Bug-fix: don't upper-case the file path when it's input for a new file in a text file section
	<li>Bug-fixes: interrupting users or chatting with users during logon process
	<li>New @-code: <tt>INCLUDE</tt><br>
		Just like <tt>TYPE</tt>, except no auto-prepending of CRLF (blank line)<br>
		Used for including <tt>head.asc</tt> and <tt>tail.asc</tt> in the new <tt>menu/main.asc</tt>
	<li>The width of fixed-width @-codes may now be specified (as a decimal number)<br>
		following the <tt>-R</tt> or <tt>-L</tt> (right or left justification) appendage<br>
		Allows expanded text to be shorter than the unexpanded @-code length<br>
		(e.g. <tt>@NODE-L2@</tt> for a left-justified 2 character node number)
	<li>Bugfix: Ctrl-A codes to move the cursor right (>0x7f) weren't working for non-ANSI users
	<li>New command-line specifier (<tt>%@</tt>) expands to <tt>exec</tt> dir on Win32
		(same as <tt>%!</tt>), blank on Unix<br>for use with <i>info-zip</i> command-lines
	<li>Command-lines containing filenames (<tt>%f</tt>) with spaces in them are now automatically
		quoted as needed
	<li>Command-lines of external programs are now logged
	<li>Additional (potentially helpful) log output when detecting QWK pack semaphore
		and mutex (lock) files
	<li>Bugfix: Baja/PCMS integer manipulation functions (e.g. ADD,SUB,MUL,DIV,AND, etc.)
		did not work if the second argument was a string variable
	<li>Password masking now handles space characters correctly
	<li>ESC immediately followed by anything other than '<tt>[</tt>' is now handled immediately
	<li>Auto-terminating JavaScript modules:<br>
		If <i>js.auto_terminate</i> is <i>true</i> (the default value) and the remote user disconnects,
		the script will automatically terminate<br>
		(use the new <i>js.on_exit()</i> method to have any critical clean-up functions perfomed during termination)
	<li>New Baja module/shell decompiler (from <i>Deuce</i>): <tt>unbaja</tt>
	</ul><br>
<li><b>JavaScript</b><ul>
	<li>Bug-fix: predictable random numbers being returned from <i>random()</i>
	<li>Bug-fix: <i>system.newuser_password</i> and <i>system.newuser_magic_word</i> were reversed
	<li>Bug-fix: <i>Queue</i> objects can now have <i>null</i> encoded/enqueued and dequeued
		without converting to an empty object or segfaulting
	<li>Bug-fix: a background-executed script (via <tt>load(true,...)</tt>) was not enqueueing
		the result of the last evaluated statement if it was <i>undefined</i><br>
		(some functions return <i>undefined</i> on failure)
	<li>Bug-fix: corrected <i>link</i> property for directories in libraries that use a "code prefix"
		(the prefix isn't used in the FTP virtual directories)
	<li>JSexec-Unix: a <tt>SIGHUP</tt> will cause a recycle/re-run
	<li>JSexec: added <tt>-f</tt> option to force console output stream to non-buffered
	<li>JSexec: added <tt>-S</tt> option to set thread stack size limit, default is 256K bytes<br> 
		This should keep JSexec from crashing due to the ircd recursion bug.<br>
		It'll log a JS exception/error and exit (or loop) instead
		<br>Use <tt>-S0</tt> to set an unlimited thread stack size (not recommended)
	<li>JSexec: if error and console messages are redirected to files (using <tt>-e</tt> and <tt>-o</tt> options)
		echo error messages to status output (default: stderr) as well
	<li>All string-modification methods now return <i>undefined</i> if passed an undefined
		value (rather than converting to the string "undefined")
	<li>Enhancements: <i>Queue.peek()</i> and <i>Queue.read()</i> now support an optional timeout
		argument (in milliseconds)
	<li><i>bbs.get_newscantime()</i> now returns <i>null</i> on abort instead of <i>undefined</i><br>
		It's been determined that <i>null</i> is the better error return value for functions
		(for one, it's easier to to enqueue/dequeue)
	<li>New feature (requested by sinister-x), if a msg header object is passed to
		<i>bbs.post_msg()</i>, it will be used for the in-relpy-to header fields and thread
		linkage automatically
	<li>Always enqueue the result of a background-executed script (even if it fails with an
		error)<br>
		If an argument is passed to <i>exit()</i>, enqueue that value instead
	<li>Global <i>sleep()</i> function now returns the number of elapsed timer ticks instead of <i>undefined</i>
	<li>Defined new global variable <i>socket_errno</i>, for debugging socket errors without an
		associated Socket object<br>
		(e.g. failed <i>resolve_ip()</i> or <i>resolve_host()</i> calls)<br>
		On *nix, this
		value will be the same as <i>errno</i>, but on Win32, it will be different
	<li>New global function: <i>flags_str()</i> to convert string flag representations
		(e.g. "A-Z") to/from numeric representation (used in the <i>user.security</i>
		properties)
	<li>New advanced function: <i>js.report_error()</i><br>
		used to report errors using the internal JS error reporter<br>
		(passing <i>false</i> as the second argument causes the script to immediately terminate)<br>
		<i>log()</i> should be used instead, for normal script error reporting
	<li>New <i>console.printfile()</i> mode flag: <tt>P_NOCRLF</tt> (defined in <tt>sbbsdefs.js</tt>)
	<li>Bug-fix: <i>log()</i> now treats a single numeric argument as the value to be logged rather than the log level
	<li>New advanced function: <i>js.on_exit()</i><br>
		used to add a string to a last-in-first-out queue
	    of strings to be automatically evaluated/executed upon termination of the script
	<li>If a <i>Date</i> object is passed as the default value to <i>File.iniGetObject()</i>, return
		a <i>Date</i> object
	<li>The object properties returned from <i>MsgBase.get_msg_index()</i> and <i>get_msg_header()</i>
		(header and index fields) are now writable
	</ul><br>
<li><b>SBBSecho</b><ul>
	<li>Work-around for BRE/FE inter-BBS attachment bug (remove pre-pended '^' from attached filename)
	<li>Fix case of attached files before placing in <tt>.?LO</tt> files (for Unix file system compatibility)
	<li>Now supports <tt>%@</tt> (for info-zip), <tt>%.</tt>, and <tt>%?</tt> command-line specifiers
		in file pack/unpack command-line
	<li>Create RFC822 mesage-IDs for imported FTN echomail messages<br>
		(for later cross-referencing of posted replies via <tt>nntpservice.js</tt>)
	</ul><br>
<li><b>Synchronet Console</b><ul>
	<li>Bug-fix: for log output, display control characters in ^X format<br>
		(ths should fix the mystery termination bug when ran from xterm and logging a Ctrl-E character)
	<li>Bug-fix: don't over-ride the Unix syslog facility type when using the sbbs <tt>-d</tt> option
		and no facility type was specified
	<li>Allow the Unix syslog identity to be configured using the <tt>sbbs.ini [Unix] LogIdent</tt> key
	<li>Allow the Unix PID file name to be configured using the <tt>sbbs.ini [Unix] PidFile</tt><br>
		(when daemonized only) default is still <tt>/var/run/sbbs.pid</tt>
	</ul><br>
<li><b>Synchronet Control Panel (for Win32)</b><ul>
	<li>Bug-fix: hostname being set to "(null)" when importing registry settings from v3.00-v3.11
	<li>List of web server index files is now configurable
	<li>External changes to <tt>ctrl/sbbs.ini</tt> are now loaded when starting servers
	<li>Bug-fix: restore the current working dir (ctrl dir) when done selecting sound
		files from configuration dialogs
	<li>Don't add selected sound files to recent documents history
	<li>Only request the minimum required security access in SCM calls<br>
		This allows <tt>sbbsctrl.exe</tt> to be run by non-admin users and still start/stop/monitor
		Synchronet NT Services
	</ul><br>
<li><b>Synchronet NT Services</b><ul>
	<li>If [-]help or [-]? is passed on the command-line, no longer attempts to start
		service control dispatcher (just displays usage)
	<li>Usage is no longer displayed if the service control dispatcher is started successfully
	<li>"/options" are supported (as well as <tt>-options</tt> and just <tt>options</tt>)
	<li>When re-enabling a disabled service, sets the service's start type to "auto" or
		"manual" based on the AutoStart settings in the startup file (e.g. <tt>sbbs.ini</tt>)
	<li>Added "list" command, to list service install/start mode and current state
	<li>Added "start" and "stop" commands to easily start and stop one or all services using sbbsNTsvcs
	<li>Added mute, unmute, and recycle commands
	<li>Allow short-hand service names on command-line (e.g. just "BBS" instead of "SynchronetBBS")
	</ul><br>
<li><b>CHKSMB</b><ul>
	<li>Detect and report number of "in-transit" messages
	<li>Detect and report number of unvalidated moderated messages
	</ul><br>
<li><b>ListServer</b><ul>
	<li>Work-around bug in v3.12a: remove msgtxt file to prevent mail server from
		attempting delivery of list contributions to user #0
	<li>Stops parsing listserver commands when tear line (<tt>---</tt>) is reached
	<li>Export no messages if the list.ptr file is empty/invalid
	<li>Report an error if no listname was specified on the subscribe/unsubscribe command line
	<li>Beautified/unified log output (include "ListServer" in all output)
	<li>Don't send help text for every invalid command (just once)
	<li>Bug-fix: moderated message posting
	<li>Bug-fix: convert sub code to lowercase for use as index into <i>msg_area.sub[]</i> array
	</ul><br>
<li><b>NewsLink</b><ul>
	<li>Bug-fix: If aborted due to disconnection, the import pointer would be off by one
		causing the next article to not be imported the next time NewsLink was run
	<li>Use XOVER to get article headers (if supported on server)<br>This reduces the
		likelihood of requesting a bad article number which some servers now consider
		worthy of disconnection!
	<li>Added <tt>-nx</tt> command-line option or "no_xover" <tt>newlink.cfg</tt> option to disable
		XOVER-on-import support
	<li>Added an "unmangle" option to <tt>newslink.cfg</tt> (or <tt>-um</tt> on the command-line)
		to automatically remove the NewsLink anti-spam measure from the e-mail address
		(if present) in imported messages
	<li>If "NNTP-Posting-Host" header field is defined, compare value to contents of
		ip and ip-silent trashcan/filter files.<br>
		Allows easy silent filtering of trash-canned twit/spammer IPs.
		Requires the latest <tt>newsutil.js</tt>
	</ul><br>
<li><b>NNTP Service</b><ul>
	<li>Added support for the LISTGROUP command (from RFC 2980)
	<li>Bug-fix: Don't allow guest/anonymous logins if the <tt>-na</tt> option is used
	<li>Bug-fix: Always logout the current user upon receipt of AUTHINFO PASS
	<li>Bug-fix: don't attempt to use <i>msgbase.cfg</i> for xref field:<br>
		use selected.newsgroup instead, which is always valid, even for the "mail" group
	<li>Bug-fix: treat messages posted by non-QWKnet accounts as "local" messages<br>
		(i.e. set <i>header.from_net_type</i> to <i>NET_NONE</i>)<br>
		This defeats the v3.12 "feature"
		in <i>msgbase.save_msg()</i>, which auto-detects the <i>from_net_type</i> based on the
		<i>from_net_addr</i>
	</ul><br>
