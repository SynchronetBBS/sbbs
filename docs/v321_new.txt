******************************************
* What's New in Synchronet Version 3.21b *
******************************************

General
~~~~~~~
o Filter files (i.e. ip[-silent].can, host.can) and related config files
  (i.e. ipfilter_exempt.cfg, spamblock.cfg) are now cached in memory by
  default
o Hosts listed in ipfilter_exempt.cfg are now exempt from any filtering from
  ip[-silent].can and host.can
o Better config (.ini) file read error detection and reporting
o Synchronet Console (sbbs[.exe]) can accept the ctrl directory as an argument
  - Consistent with sbbsctrl.exe usage
o Store/reuse each server's client highwater mark for MQTT publishing
  - Issue #910
o Add support to SMBLIB for "Fixed" format message text
  (e.g. for messages uploaded in raw input mode)
o Better support for maintaining/rebuilding message base indexes while in-use
o Support short (8-char) less ambiguous "verbal" dates in multiple formats
  for display purposes (e.g. "Jan02'26" instead of "01/02/26")
o Expand 16-bit unsigned integer statistical user fields to 32-bit
  increasing maximum values from 65535 to 4.2B
o Address concurrency issues with user daily statistics/free credit fields
  - Each user's stats reset date/time stamp now stored in user base/record
o Improvements to daily backups of mail and user data
  - Don't back up files when empty
  - Log the total bytes and items (users and messages) backed up
o Support tracking and limiting of user file downloads "per day" - issue #938
o System statistics and mail message counts are now cached (default: for 5s)
o Increased from 40 to 60 characters the maximum length of descriptions (long
  name) of message groups and sub-boards and file libraries and directories
o The SCFG->Networks->Internet E-Mail and FidoNet "Allow Sending of ..."
  options now apply to sysops as well as users; sysops are not automatically
  exempt from this setting
o WIP ARS keyword restored for run-time compatibility with old Baja modules
  (e.g. matrix.bin)
o User properties (data/user/####.ini) are now exposed to ARS and @-codes
  - New ARS Keyword PROP[:section]:key to check the truthiness of a property
  - New @-codes (YESNO and ONOFF) for checking Access Requirement Strings
    (not just user properties) which may be used to get/display Yes/No or
    On/Off text strings based on the full ARS comparison
  - New @-code (PROP[:section]:key) to get/display the *value* of any user
    property (not just its truthiness)
o Increased max files per directory from 65535 to 4.2B (99999 via SCFG)
  (0/unlimited remains an option)
o Track user bytes downloaded (in files) per day
  - Reflect these stats in drop files that support it:
    DOOR.SYS, CALLINFO.BBS, and SFDOORS.DAT

  terminal scroll-back (see/use new P_SEEK mode with console.printfile()
  and (the new) printfile.js
o Use SAUCE record embedded in display files (e.g. *.ANS, *.MSG), when present,
  to automatically determine expected display width (in columns)

  settings: whatever attributes the sysop places there will be used for
  Ctrl-AU (userhigh) and Ctrl-Au (userlow)
o Similar to above, Ctrl-AV (mnehigh) and Ctrl-Av (mnelow) can be used for
  those sysop-configurable attributes
o Modified text and menu files can now be placed in mods/text/

Security
~~~~~~~~
o Improved TLS and SSH error handling/logging
o New ARS keyword: DLT (Downloads Today)
o New option: SCFG->System->Security->Create Self-signed Certificate
  See issue #881
o Remove sorbes.net from ctrl/dns_blacklist.cfg as it is has ceased operation
o Rework part of the "good password" checking algorithm:
  Require that a good password contain a sequence of unique characters
  (not repeating, incrementing, or decrementing in ASCII code value) of at
  least half the configured minimum password length. By default, the minimum
  password length is 4 chars, so this means a sequence of at least 2 unique
  characters is required. If the minimum password length is increased by the
  sysop, so is the minimum required unique sequence length. The
  "PasswordInvalid" text.dat string is printed when passwords are rejected
  by this criteria.

  Previously, the following would be rejected by this portion of the algo,
  this logic has been replaced by the above:
  - all chars the same (would print the "PasswordInvalid" text.dat string)
  - first 4 chars are incrementing ("PasswordObvious" string printed)
  - first 4 chars are decrementing ("PasswordObvious" string printed)
  but now, a password that starts with "1234" or "abcd" is fine so long as
  it's longer than that and contains the minimum unique sequence length. This
  will prevent SBBS from rejecting high quality (e.g. randomly generated or
  crypto-hashed) passwords that just happen to begin with an incrementing
  sequence of 4 digits or alpha-characters.

  To enable high quality/entropy password checking, set SCFG->System->Security
  ->Demand High Quality Password to "Yes".
  This option defaults to false since the "quality" standard is higher than it
  used to be and that could be confusing for sysops or users.

  allows sysop to choose "Fast Allocation" Storage Method if needed/preferred
  but requires periodic MailBase packing to keep manage disk usage/free space
o New System->Security Options->Security Level Values... "Downloads Per Day"
  (D/D): defaults to 0/Unlimited for each level
o System->Loadable Modules now allows multiple modules to be configured per
  "Loadable Module" type, restricting access based on Access Requirements (ARS)
o System->Short Date Format can be used to select a verbal or numeric date
  format (of many forms) for displaying short dates
o New option: SCFG->External Programs->Fixed Events->New User ...
o External Programs->Fixed Events now supports multiple events (i.e. commands)
  per event type
o Remove external editor option: "Expand LF to CRLF" - no longer needed
o Each configured sub-board can have each extra attribute type toggled on/off
o Access Requirements editing menu updated to include terminal and user types
o Creating new File Options->Viewable/Testable/Extractable/Compressible Files,
  Download Events, or Transfer Protocols now prompts for the required fields
  rather than copying values from an adjacent already configured item or (when
  the list is empty) pre-populating with default values
o Resolved issue of System menu detecting changes by the sysop
  (and prompting to Save Changes when exiting) when no changes were actually
  made, just that DST had been auto-enabled/disabled based on the date

SBBSecho
~~~~~~~~
o Extracts/imports inbound bundles starting from 6 days ago, not always Sunday
o Auto-enable "EchoList Only" areamgr mode when EchoList Keys are used

o Support robots that use .msg files directly
  Each configured robot now has a "Uses MSG File" option (defaults to false)
o Don't write empty PATH: control line to exported echomail message
  Points don't normally have any addresses to add to the PATH: line, so
  (as was pointed out in the FIDOTEST echo), an empty PATH: line would be
  included in exported echomail messages from points.
  Although this isn't a violation of FTS-4, it is a violation of its proposed
  successor: FSC-74: "Blank" path lines shall not be transmitted
o Don't list REQ (file request) files in flow files per FTS-5005
o Allow a "max message count" to be specified in AreaMgr "rescan" requests
  - The -R option (in the subject), can now include a message count (-R=count)
  - The %RESCAN function (in the body) can now include a message count
    i.e. %RESCAN [area-tag] [R=<count>]
o Add "maximum message age" in days option for AreaMgr %RESCAN use
  - Support for -D=<days> in message subject and D=<days> option in
    %RESCAN and %RESCAN <area-tag> commands
  - The -R subject option can be used in combination with the %RESCAN D=
    option (or vice versa) to both limit the number *and* the age of messages,
	if desired
  - Issue #929
