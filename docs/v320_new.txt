*****************************************
* What's New in Synchronet Version 3.20 *
* (ChangeLog since v3.19b Jan 2, 2022)  *
*****************************************

General
~~~~~~~
o New userbase (see https://wiki.synchro.net/history:newuserbase for details)
o New primary configuration files: http://wiki.synchro.net/history:newcfgfiles
o New statistics file formats
  - */dsts.dab (daily statistics and running totals) -> */dsts.ini
  - */csts.dab (cumulative statistics / log) -> */csts.tab
  - DSTSEDIT (daily stats editor) goes away: just edit the dsts.ini file
o Baja: Make !INCLUDE directives filename case-insensitive
  - some old command shells/mods wouldn't compile on *nix systems otherwise

Security
~~~~~~~~
o Disallow new user aliases from matching an existing user's real name
o Implement duplicate new-user email address checking (optional)
  - Set SCFG->System->New User Prompts->Force Unique E-mail/NetMail to "Yes"
o New 'O' restriction is automatically applied to accounts with a duplicate
  real name (when allowed by the sysop) and prevent such users from posting
  or sending mail with their real name
o Change the semantics of the "Allow Sysop Logins" setting in SCFG->System:
  an account with sysop access (i.e. level 90+) can still login, but any
  action that normally requires the system password will not be allowed. This
  includes the sysop-actions available in the FTP server when authenticating
  with  <user-pass>:<system-pass> as the password. The sysop-user can still
  authenticate (and login), but none of those sysop-actions will be available
  to them.
  Renamed/moved to SCFG->System->Security Options->Toggles->Allow Sysop Access

Customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o New stock modules: msgscancfg.js and filescancfg.js
  Replaces logic previously copy/pasted into multiple Baja command shells
o New @-codes:
  - BUILD_DATE
  - BUILD_TIME
  - CPS
  - OS_CPU
  - TRUNCATE
  - TRUNCOFF
  - GETDIM
  - LINEDELAY[:n]
o @-codes can now be included in text centered with the CENTER @-code
  Note: this centering logic does not know the expanded-size of the @-code, so
  use a fixed-length @-code (e.g. with padding) or use the 'C' @-code format
  modifier instead
o Fixed negative MSG_SCORE @-code value on 64-bit *nix builds
o New text.dat strings:
  - HashingFile
  - HashedFile
  - YouCantUseThatNetmail
  - NewUserValEmailSubj
  - InactivityAlert
  - FreeDownloadUserMsg 
o New text.dat strings for received Fido and Internet mail
  - InternetMailReceived
  - InternetMailForwarded
  - FidoNetMailReceived
  - WithAttachment
  - FidoEchoMailReceived
    For The Millionaire (RIP?), closing issue #254
    The first string (suppressed with %.0s) is an optional date/time stamp.
    This also deprecates (removes support for) the [mail] NewMailNotice and
    ForwardNotice keys in sbbs.ini
 
Windows
~~~~~~
o Synchronet runs on Windows XP again
  Fixed 'The procedure entry point inet_ntop could not be located in the
  dynamic link library WS2_32.dll'
o Ignore VDD WriteFile() failures if the child process has terminated
  If the child process (e.g. door game) has terminated, don't log errors
  if/when WriteFile() to the mailslot fails. This would be expected as the
  mailslot is created/owned-by sbbsexec.dll which would also terminate along
  with the process, thus closing the mailslot
o Suppress "VDD Open failed" warning if child process terminated
o Many improvements to the Virtual UART Driver as a result of SVDM development:
  - Report CTS status in FOSSIL driver (high when outbuf has some space)
  - Emulate FIFO enablement
  - Support RTS flow control
  - Report "DCD change" in MSR correctly
o Synchronet Control Panel (sbbsctrl.exe) now has a "Log Events to Disk"
  option, enabling writing of event thread log messages to data/events*.log
o New useredit.exe (all new C++ version, but using the old Delphi forms)

Configuration Utility (SCFG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Displays path/filename of config file actively being edited, not date/time
o Supports cycling through like-items using left/right arrow keys
  e.g. comparing/glancing through grps, subs, libs, and dirs, is really easy!
o New "Servers" menu: Almost all settings in the sbbs.ini file are now
  configurable here
o New "Initial Setup Wizard" runs automatically on new-install or via '-w' opt
  Similar to the SBBSCTRL:Configuration Wizard in function, but TUI, not GUI
o Moved Node->Toggle Options->Allow Login by User Number, Login by Real Name,
  Always Prompt for Password, to (new) System->Security Options
o Moved Node->Advanced Options->Validation user, Notification User, and
  Notification Error Level to (new) System->Notifications menu

  value to include the new (higher) node number
o Moved security settings from "System" menu to (new) System->Security Options
  - Password
  - Users Can Change Password
  - Days to Preserve Deleted Users
  - Maximum Days of Inactivity
  - New User Password (now prompted when setting Security->Open to New Users)
  - Security Level Values, Expired Account Values, and Quick-Validation Values
  - Toggle Options->Allow Sysop Logins, Display/Log Passwords Locally, Users
    Expire when Out-of-time, Require Sys Pass during Login, and
    Closed to New Users
o Added System->New User Values->QWK Packet Settings
o Added New User Chat options to System->New User Values->Default Toggles:
  Multinode Chat Echo, Multinode Chat Actions, Pageable for Chat,
  Node Activity Messages, and Split-Screen Private Chat
o Moved System->New User Values->Question Toggles to System->New User Prompts
o Added System->Advanced->Maximum Log File Size (enable/control log rotation)
o Added System->Loadable Modules->Send Feedback, Chat Section, List Users,
  Scan Dirs, List Files, View File Info, Batch Transfer
  - *All* configured loadable modules can now include command-line options
o File Directory->Toggle->Template for New replaced with File Library->
  Directory Defaults...
  "Clone Options" moved to Directory Defaults->Clone Settings
o New File Library options:
  Upload Requirements, Download Requirements, Operator Requirements, Exemption
  Requirements, Auto-Add Sub-directories, Virtual Sub-directories
o Internal codes (prefixes and suffixes) have doubled in maximum length
o Add "Native" option for QWKnet call-out Command-lines
o Add an 'enabled' property for QWKnet hubs, defaults to true
o Move the QWKnet hub pack and unpack commands to an "Advanced" sub-menu since
  they are completely optional now (SBBS uses libarchive otherwise)
o Trim leading and trailing white-space in input strings, automatically
o Don't allow spaces when entering/editing internal codes
o Configuration file back-ups are now configured (in SCFG->System->Advanced)
  rather than controlled via command-line option (-b) to SCFG
o New command-line option (-A) to enable alternate/ASCII arrow symbols
o SCFG Command-line options are now case-sensitive ('-a' and '-A' are unique)
o SCFG Command-line options must be preceded with '-', not '/', on all OSes
o '?' key can be used to pull-up online help (e.g. when F1 key is not working)

JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~
o Command-shells can be written entirely in JavaScript, no .bin stub needed
o New property: file_area.web_vpath_prefix
o file_area.min_diskspace is in bytes now, not kilobytes
o file-metadata-object (return value of FileBase.get()).vpath
o system methods for vetting filenames (e.g. for upload by users)
  - illegal_filename() - check if contains illegal chars/sequences
  - safest_filename() - check if contains only safest chars
  - allowed_filename() - check if meets criteria from SCFG->File Options
  - check_filename() - check if legal and meets configured criteria and
    is not in file.can
o bbs.check_filename() - ditto, except will display badfile.msg as appropriate
o MsgBase.save_msg() throws an exception when empty recipient list is provided
o Restore ability for MsgBase.open() to open an arbitrary SMB msgbase
o Remember the last 'first_msg' property value after MsgBase is closed
o Fixed user.dat open file descriptor leak in User object constructor
o New User.stats.download_cps property
o New User.mail_settings property
o New User.close() method

  backfill effect (when supported by the terminal)
o File.readBin() and writeBin() methods now support 64-bit integer binary data
o New method: File.iniRemoveSections()

Servers
~~~~~~~
o MQTT (IoT protocol) statistics/status/output publishing and control
  See https://wiki.synchro.net/ref:mqtt for details
o Allow a configured maximum-severity (minimum value) for TLS-related log
  messages, default is 0 (LOG_EMERG, maximum severity)
o All servers support login-by-realname/user-number (if enabled by the sysop)
o systemd integration (status reporting) on *nix builds
o Fix uploader-notification, credit awards, download-counters in FTP downloads

Services
~~~~~~~~
o Allow a per-service "LowestLogLevel" setting
  Have a service (e.g. imapservice.js) that logs errors that you'd rather not
  fill your error.log file with? Set that service's "LowestLogLevel" to
  "Warning" in your services.ini file ("lower" means "more severe" when it
  comes to log levels, so this would set the maximum severity to Warning)

Terminal Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Socket inactivity watchdog now supported and configurable with separate
  maximum inactivity values for Login, New User Registration, and normal
  User Session (SCFG->Servers->Terminal Server->Max * Inactivity settings)
  - This inactivity detection works even when scripts don't call getkey()
    but is reset upon received TCP traffic of any kind (even Telnet NOP/GA)
o Progress-update displays are now optimized for slow (e.g. modem) connections
o Basic PETSCII output column/line counting support (for auto-pause)
o Displayed Instant Messages (notifications and telegrams) are now stored
  and historic messages viewable via ;msgs command and 'V' from the ^P prompt
o New display file naming (*.cXX.[asc|msg|ans|rip|seq]) where XX is the
  /minimum/ column width (not necessarily the exact column width)
  The old *.XXcol.* naming is still supported for exact-column-width files
o ASC/MSG versions of display files are no longer required
  If all a sysop wants to create/use are .ans files, they can do that,
  non-ANSI users be damned
o Use nearest-zone matching for source FTN address when replying to netmail
o Fix lost 'unexpected characters' received in ANSI get cursor position
  response (issue #304)
o newuser.js has a new 'notify_sysop' option (enabled via modopts.ini)
  Will notify the sysop via email and telegram whenever a new user account has
  been created
o Configurable system password timeout (default: 15 minutes)
o Fix PETSCII 40/80 column port connections for IPv6
o [BBS]
  DefaultTermWidth=80
  DefaultTermHeight=24
o Online user editor display more of the user's (long) password
o Increase user's hostname field (aka user_t.comp) from 30 to 60 chars
o Most sysops didn't know it, but if exec/feedback.* existed, it would be
  executed just before any user sent an email to the sysop (user #1),
  excluding new user validation requests:
  - make this module name configurable and loadable from mods
  - support JS module here (exit(1) to abort the feedback)
  - invoke for email being sent to *any* sysop (not just user #1)
  - don't invoke the module when sending *from* a sysop account
o Make new user QWK-related and Chat-related settings configurable
  - Added chat-settings to SCFG->System->New User Values->Default Toggles
  - Added new menu: SCFG->System->New User Values->QWK Packet Settings
o New line-based method of output throttling (e.g for animated ANSIs)
  Enabled/set via LINEDELAY @-code and JS console.line_delay property

Doors
~~~~~
o New option to Alert/Disconnect an Inactive User while running program
o Fix EXITINFO.BBS drop file generation (a few problems with size and garbage)
o Total rewrite of the PCBOARD.SYS and USERS.SYS drop file generation logic
o Limit DOOR.SYS drop file numeric values to 32767
  - Fixes issues with doors using The DoorFrame door library (e.g Lemonade!)
o Populate line 36 (user alias) of DOOR.SYS with the current user's handle
  Previously, we just always made this a blank line
o Add line 8 (user's real name) to DOORFILE.SR (Solar Realms' drop file)
o Dates in drop files are now always in MM/DD/YY format, never DD/MM/YY
o Line 37 ("Event Time") of DOOR.SYS was always 00:00, now it'll be the
  next event time (in HH:MM format)
o Add "Disable Local Display" option for doors
  New option to disable local screen display for door programs: sets the
  'Screen' value appropriately in door.sys or pcboard.sys drop files and on
  Windows, doesn't create a new console window.
o Parse DOSXTRN.ERR
  Also, now parsing the DOSXTRN.ERR file created by the latest/greatest
  dosxtrn.exe when failing to execute the child/DOS program and log the parsed
  error details (errno value and description), helpful in debugging the reason
  why a DOS program may not have been successfully executed by DOSXTRN
o When user hangs-up on external programs on *nix, try to terminate w/SIGTERM
  Previously, when a user disconnected or ran out of time while running a
  stdio-based external program on *nix, if the program was still running, we'd
  send it a SIGHUP, wait up to 10 seconds for the process to terminate and if
  it did not, terminate it (ungracefully) with SIGKILL. Since some programs
  catch SIGTERM (and not SIGHUP) to indicate a termination request, we now
  will first attempt a SIGHUP, wait up to 5 seconds for the process to
  terminate and if it does not, then send a SIGTERM and wait up to another 5
  seconds for it to terminate and if it doesn't, then finally send it a
  SIGKILL (which cannot be caught and always results in an ungraceful
  termination of the child process)

File Transfers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Extracted DIZ from sub-directory of archive does not preempt root DIZ File
o Increased maximum extended file description length from 4000 to 5000 chars
o Filenames > 12 chars use liberal filename matching
  (fixes issue seen at https://youtu.be/_IWzIV0_sZ4?t=310)
o Allow maximum uploaded filename length to be configured (default: 64)
o Searching for file descriptions in the Terminal Server, now searching file's
  tags, author, and author group, if available
o Fixed issue (#328) removing files from batch queues
o Fix "Testable Files" file extension comparison (issue #331)
  Issue introduced in v3.19: Testable Files (a.k.a. upload processors) with a
  specified file extension/type (e.g. "ZIP" and not "*") would never run
  because the file extension comparison logic was "off by one". Testable Files
  with an extension of "*" (all files/types) would still run however.
o Implement the sbbsfile.nam and sbbsfile.des post-processing removed in v3.19
o Auto-detect/display UTF-8 encoded extended file descriptions
o Improved support for files > 4GB in size
o Add options to sort directories by file size (ascending or descending)
o Allow sysop-choice of source of virtual sub-directory source name:
  By default, each file transfer directory's internal code suffix is
  used as the source of the sub-directory of the virtual path used
  to represent a file area in the FTP and Web servers. Now, a sysop
  can change that source to either each directory's short name or
  long name, if they prefer.
o Removed FTP server DIR_FILES option (no longer applicable)
o Fix: Use the user's default download protocol for batch downloads
o Increase maximum file extension length from 3 to 15 characters (e.g. tar.gz)
o Fix bug (issue #515) with moving files between directories
o Minimum disk space more universally enforced and no longer limited to 65535K
o Better access enforcement to files in batch download queues
o Remove defunct files from batch download queue during logon
o Store/reuse file download throughput (in CPS), for transfer estimates/ETA

Message Bases/Areas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Sanity check sub-board's assigned FTN addresses when loading configuration
  (use nearest matching configured AKA)
o Fixed QWKnet netmail dest user look-up (using qnet/users.dat)
  broken back in 2021
o Fix heap corruption in decoding of quoted-printable text in smblib
o Fix erroneous filtering of vote messages by age
  e.g. !Filtering QWK message from (null) due to age: 19321 days
o Fix: Include blank lines in messages edited with internal editor
o Don't save draft messages upon disconnect for Guest or "no one" (user #0)
o Improved MIME/QP-encoded message text parsing

SBBSecho
~~~~~~~~
o Don't use libarchive for creating/appending bundles
  - Must use (have configured) external archive program (e.g. zip)
o New EchoCfg->Global->Sort Linked Node List option
o Supports filtering messages based on text/subject.can file
o Rework NetMail routing logic to handle point destinations better
o Options for handling of incoming bad packets
  - delete
  - rename *.bad (the previous behavior)
  - rename *.<reason>.bad (the new default behavior)

HatchIT
~~~~~~~
o New non-interactive mode (patch by @acn)
o Generates MS-DOS compatible 'File' key values and 'Lfile' key when source
  filename is not MS-DOS compatible

Web Server
~~~~~~~~~~
o Direct Filebase access for downloading files with access controls,
  notifications, updated statistics and credits (optional, enabled
  via SCFG->Servers->Web Server->Filebase VPath Prefix (e.g. "/files/")
o Dynamic file area/base indexing
  (set sbbs.ini [web] FileIndexScript to webfileindex.ssjs for demo)
o Requested-path aliasing, via ctrl/web_alias.ini
o Log requests that resolve outside of the web root as hack attempts
o Fix HTTP-requests for files >= 2GB in size
o Perform a JS garbage collection for each new request in a reused session
o Add UNIX domain FastCGI support (in *nix builds only)

Mail Server
~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fix corrupted RFC822 msg headers when a header field was > 1024 chars
o Reject SMTP session from any client that sends illegally-long lines
o Fix false FORGED mail header 'FROM' field detection/rejection

FTP Server
~~~~~~~~~~
o Limit uploaded file sizes, accounting for free disk space
o Fix uploader-notification, credit awards, download-counters in downloads
o Fix false "SUSPECTED BOUND ATTACK ATTEMPT" for IPv6 active-data connections
o Source of virtual sub-directory names are now configurable in SCFG
  - May be derived from internal code suffix (default), the short or long name
