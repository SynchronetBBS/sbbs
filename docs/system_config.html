<h2><a name="SystemConfiguration">[2.0] - System Configuration</a></h2>
<pre>SCFG is the Synchronet Configuration Utility. It is a stand-alone console mode 
application (e.g. SCFG.EXE for Windows).</pre>
<pre>To run SCFG from the Synchronet Control Panel (Windows), select <i>Configure</i> from the <i>
BBS</i> sub-menu on the menu bar.</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/sbbsctrl_configure.png" width="301" height="192"></pre>
<pre>Once SCFG has initialized, you will see a main menu titled &quot;Configure&quot; which looks 
something like this:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_main.png" width="572" height="331">
			
To manipulate the light-bar, use the <i>UP</i> and <i>DOWN ARROW</i> keys or type a letter or
number in the option you wish to highlight. To highlight the first option of
the menu, hit the <i>HOME</i> key. To highlight the last option of the menu, hit the 
<i>END</i> key. You'll notice that if you hit <i>UP ARROW</i> key when the light-bar is at the 
first option of the menu, the last option will become highlighted. This wrap effect 
also occurs when hitting the DOWN ARROW key when the light-bar is at the last option 
of the menu. To select the current highlighted option, hit <i>ENTER</i>. To exit SCFG,
hit the <i>ESC</i> key.</pre>
<pre>Under &quot;System&quot;, set your system's name (BBS Name), the sysop's name (You), the
system location (City, State), and system password. The system password you
enter here will be required for any remote sysop operations and is prompted
for with an &quot;<b>SY:</b>&quot; prompt. Under &quot;<a href="#Message Options">Message Options</a>&quot;, set your system's QWK ID
(Up to 8 character BBS name abbreviation). Under &quot;Toggle Options&quot; set
&quot;Allow Aliases&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; depending on if you want users to be known
by their real names on your BBS or a personal alias.</pre>
<pre>Remember that at any time within SCFG, you can hit the <i>F1</i> key to get online
help about the current configuration window. Following is a more specific list
of the commands available in the SCFG under System options.</pre>
<h2><b><a name="MessageOptions">[2.1] - </a> </b><a name="MessageOptions"><b>Message Options</b></a>
<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="images/scfg_msg_options.png" width="572" height="331"></h2>
<pre><b>BBS ID for QWK Packets:</b>
	This is the ID that will be used in QWK packets. It is important that
	you set this to an abbreviation of your BBS name before users start
	using the QWK functions of your BBS. Only valid DOS filename characters
	can be used and the ID must begin with an alphabetic character. This
	ID will also serve as your system's QWK Network address, should you
	choose to join a QWK message network (e.g. <a href="dove-net.txt">DOVE-Net</a>).

<b>Local Time Zone:</b>
	This should be set to the time zone where your BBS is located.

<b>Maximum Retry Time:</b>
	This is the maximum number of seconds the Synchronet message base
	library will wait for a locked message base to become unlocked.
	Under normal conditions, message bases are only left locked for an
	extremely short period of time.

<b>Maximum QWK Messages:</b>
	This is the maximum number of messages which will be packed when a
	QWK packet is created. If the number of new messages to be packed
	exceeds this, the packing will be stopped after packing this number
	of messages. Setting this value to 0 sets the number of messages
	per packet to unlimited. Private e-mail is not included in the total
	number of messages and QWK network nodes are automatically exempt
	from this maximum.

<b>Pre-pack QWK Requirements:</b>
	If this option is used (not blank), Synchronet will pre-pack any new
	messages into a QWK packet in the DATA\FILE directory for each user
	that meets this requirement. When that user calls to download their
	packet, it will automatically extract the pre-packed QWK (if it
	exists) and append to it. It is mainly intended for QWKnet nodes that
	feed from your BBS, but can also be used for long distance users that
	wish to save connect time and always read their messages via QWK.

<b>Purge E-mail by Age:</b>
	This will allow electronic mail for your users (stored in DATA\MAIL.*)
	to be purged after a specific number of days (read or unread).

<b>Purge Deleted E-mail:</b>
	This option can be set to &quot;Daily&quot; or &quot;Immediately&quot;. If set to
	&quot;Immediately&quot;, e-mail marked for deletion will be physically removed
	from the e-mail database immediately after the user exits the
	reading mail menu. If set to &quot;Daily&quot; (the suggested setting), e-mail
	is marked for deletion isn't physically removed from the database
	until the automatic daily event executes (sometime after midnight).

<b>Duplicate E-mail Checking:</b>
	This option allows the setting of a number of message CRCs to be kept
	to check e-mail to insure that it is not a duplicate of another piece
	of e-mail. This option should be set to 0 (disabled) unless you
	specifically want duplicate e-mail disallowed, in which case a value
	of 2000 should be sufficient.

<b>Allow Anonymous E-mail:</b>
	Setting this option to Yes will allow users with the 'A' exemption to
	send anonymous e-mail.

<b>Allow Quoting in E-mail:</b>
	To allow users to quote from e-mail, this option should be set to Yes.

<b>Allow Uploads in E-mail:</b>
	To allow users to attach files to e-mail, this option must be set to
	Yes.

<b>Allow Forwarding to NetMail:</b>
	If you allow users to send NetMail on your BBS and want to allow your
	users to set their account to forwarding their e-mail to a NetMail
	address, set this option to Yes.

<b>Kill Read E-mail:</b>
	If you would like to have any e-mail that has been read by the
	recipient automatically deleted by the message base maintenance program
	(SMBUTIL) set this option to yes.

<b>Users Can View Deleted Messages:</b>
	This option allows all users or sysops/sub-ops the ability to view
	messages (posts/e-mail) marked for deletion (and optionally undelete
	them) before they are permanently removed from the message base.

<b>Extra Attribute Codes...:</b>
	This option will give you a sub-menu of toggle options. These options
	tell Synchronet whether or not it should interpret color codes which
	are supported by other BBS packages.</pre>

[2.2] - System Options</a></h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system.png" width="572" height="331">

<b>BBS Name:</b>
        This is the name of the BBS. Try to be original. :-)

<b>Location:</b>
        This is the city, state and/or other pertinent location information.

<b>Operator:</b>
        This is the name of the system operator. Doesn't have to be the same
        as user #1, but usually is.

<b>Password:</b>
        This is the super-secret system password that only sysops should know.

<b>Users Can Change Password:</b>
        If you want enhanced system security, it is suggested that you force
        users to keep the original randomly generated password they were
        assigned by setting this option to No. If you do allow users to change
        their passwords, you can make them change their password periodically
        with this selection.

<b>Days to Preserve Deleted Users:</b>
        If a user is deleted, his slot will be preserved for this many days
        since his last logon date. Preserved slots will not be written over
	by new users. Preserved slots may be undeleted by the sysop.

<b>Maximum Days of Inactivity:</b>
        If you wish that users that haven't logged on in a certain number of
        days be automatically deleted, set this value to the maximum number
        of days a user can be inactive before he is deleted. Users can be
        exempted from the automatic deletion with the 'P' exemption. Setting
        this value to 0 disables this feature (Unlimited inactivity).

<b>New User Password:</b>
        If this field has a value, new users will have to enter this password
        correctly before being able apply for access.</pre>
<h2><b><a name="SystemToggleOptions">[2.3] - </a> </b><a name="SystemToggleOptions"><b>System Toggle Options</b></a></h2>
<pre>Selecting this option will bring you to the following sub-menu:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_toggle.png" width="572" height="331"></pre>
<pre><b>Allow Aliases:</b>
        If you wish the users of the BBS to be allowed to use aliases publicly,
        set this option to Yes.

<b>Allow Time Banking:</b>
	Set this option to Yes to allow users to store their time in a time
	bank, or to convert their credits to time via the BBS.

<b>Allow Credit Conversions:</b>
	Setting this option to Yes will allow users to be able to convert
	credits to time.

<b>Allow Sysop Logins:</b>
	To be able to perform sysop actions remotely, this option should be set
	to Yes.

<b>Echo Passwords Locally:</b>
	If this option is set to No, all BBS passwords will not be displayed
	locally (characters will be replaced by an X). This includes passwords
	entered during logon, passwords in the user editor, as well as
	passwords normally displayed on the status line.

<b>Short Sysop Page:
</b>	If set to Yes, this sysop page will be a short series of beeps,
	otherwise a continuous sysop page will be used.

<b>Sound Alarm on Error:
</b>	If the above option (beep locally) is toggled off, but you still wish
	to have errors produce an audible alarm, you should toggle this option
	to Yes.

<b>Include Sysop in Statistics:
</b>        It is suggested that you set this option to No, so that the sysop's
        activity on the BBS is not included in the usage statistics.

<b>Closed to New Users:
</b>        If you wish to disallow access to any new users, set this option to
        Yes.

<b>Use Location In User Lists:
</b>        If you wish the location (City, State) of the user to be displayed
        in user listings instead of the user note, set this option to Yes.
        Setting this option to No will display the user's note (sysop created)
	if one has been created. The option should be set to Yes if using
	Caller-ID since the user's note may contain their phone number.

<b>Military (24 hour) Time Format:
</b>	Use this option to toggle your BBS between 12 and 24 hour time formats.

<b>European Date Format (DD/MM/YY):
</b>	This option should ONLY be toggle to Yes if you are in a European
	country which uses this date format. All countries using the MM/DD/YY
	format should leave this option set to No. If your BBS has been running
	for any length of time with this option set to No, you should NOT
	change it to Yes.

<b>User Expires When Out-of-time:
</b>	Useful for BBSs which charge users based on time, this option, when set
	to Yes, will set a user to the expired account values once the user's
	time runs out.</pre>
<pre><b>Display Sys Info During Logon:
</b>	Display &quot;hard-coded&quot; system information during BBS logon process.</pre>
<pre><b>Display Node List During Logon:
</b>	Display list of active BBS nodes during BBS logon process.</pre>
<h2><b><a name="NewUserValues">[2.4] - </a></b><a name="NewUserValues"><b>New 
User Values</b></a> </h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_newvalues.png" width="572" height="331"></pre>
<pre>This option allows you to modify the security values assigned to a new user
account. You can also set the number of credits and minutes new users start
off with. If you have configured an alternate command shell or external
editors, you may select one of these as the default for new users. See the
<a href="user_editor.html">User Editor</a> chapter for more information about user account values.</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_newvalues_toggles.png" width="572" height="331"></pre>
<pre>The 'Default Toggles' are used to set the account defaults that users will have
when they log on to the system as a new user. These account defaults can be
changed by the user at logon, or while on the system from the user defaults
menu.</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_newvalues_questions.png" width="572" height="331"></pre>
<pre>The 'Question Toggles' are used to enable/disable the different questions which
new users will be asked when logging on to the BBS. The 'Force Unique...'
question toggles are used to force users to pick a string that is not being
used by any of the other users currently in the system user database.</pre>
<h2><b><a name="AdvancedOptions">[2.5] - Advanced Options</a>
</b></h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_advanced.png" width="572" height="331">

<b>New User Magic Word:
</b>        If this field has a value, it is assumed the sysop would have put
        some reference to this &quot;magic word&quot; in NEWUSER.MSG and the user
        will be prompted for this after he enters his own assigned password.
        If he doesn't enter it correctly, it is assumed he didn't read the
        text displayed to him and he is disconnected.

<b>Data Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the directory where all the data files for
	Synchronet will be stored. This value should not be changed unless
	necessary.

<b>Logs Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the directory where all the logs files for
        Synchronet will be stored. This value should not be changed unless
	necessary.

<b>Exec Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the directory where all the executable files for
        Synchronet are stored. This value should not be changed unless
	necessary.

<b>Mods Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the directory where sysop-modified modules
	(.bin and .js files) for Synchronet are stored. Normally, this
	directory will be empty. If a sysop wishes to modify a stock/standard
	module and protect the modified file from being over-written during
	subsequent Synchronet upgrades, the sysop should copy the file from
	the <b>Exec</b> directory to the <b>Mods</b> directory where it will take precedence
	over the file by the same name in the <b>Exec</b> directory. 
<b>
Input SIF Questionnaire:
</b>        This is the name of a SIF file that resides the text directory that
        all users will be prompted to answer upon logging on the first time.
        See SIF for more information.

<b>Output SIF Questionnaire:
</b>        This is the name of the SIF file that is used by the sysop to view
        the users' answers to the input SIF questionnaire. If this value is
        left blank, the input SIF questionnaire is used. This output SIF
        questionable should be identical to the input SIF with the exception
        of the text content. See SIF for more information.

<b>Credits Per Dollar:
</b>        This is the monetary value of a credit (How many credits per dollar).
        This value should be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc.)
        since credits are usually converted by 100 kilobyte (102400) blocks.
        To make a dollar worth two megabytes of credits, set this value to
        2,097,152 (a megabyte is 1024*1024 or 1048576).

<b>Minutes Per 100k Credits:
</b>        This is the value of a minute of time online. Credits can be converted
	to minutes by the user if allowed by the command shell. Credits are
	only converted in 100k (102400) blocks. This field is the number of
	minutes to give the user in exchange for the 100k credit block.

<b>Maximum Number of Minutes:
</b>        This value is the maximum total number of minutes a user can have. If
        the user has this number of minutes or more, he will not be allowed
        to convert credits into minutes. A sysop can add minutes to a user's
        account regardless of this maximum. If this value is set to 0, the
        user will have no limit on the total number of minutes he can have.

<b>Warning Days Till Expire:</b>
	When a users account is about to expire, the BBS will begin sending
	expiration warning messages to the users notifying them this many days
	in advance.

<b>Default Status Line <i><font color="#FF0000">(v2 Only)</font></i>:</b>
	This is the number of the status line that will be displayed by default
	at the bottom of the screen while the user is online.

<b>Last Displayable Node:</b>
	This is the number of the last node that will be viewable by the users.
	Any nodes which exist above this number will be &quot;invisible&quot; nodes and
	cannot be seen by anyone.

<b>Phone Number Format:</b>
	This is the format used for phone numbers in your local calling 
	area. Use N for number positions, A for alphabetic, or ! for any 
	character. All other characters will be static in the phone number 
	format. An example for North American phone numbers is <i>NNN-NNN-NNNN</i>.

<b>Sysop Chat Override:
</b>	Any user meeting the criteria set here will be able to page the sysop
	regardless of the status of the sysop availability.</pre>
<pre><b>User Database Backups:
</b>	Setting this option to anything but 0 will enable automatic daily 
	backups of the user database. This number determines how many backups
	to keep on disk (i.e. data/user/user.#.dat and data/user/name.#.dat). 

<b>Mail Database Backups:
</b>	Setting this option to anything but 0 will enable automatic daily 
	backups of the mail database. This number determines how many backups
	to keep on disk (i.e. data/mail.#.*). 

<b>Control Key Pass-through:
</b>	This value is a 32-bit hexadecimal number. Each set bit represents a 
	control key combination that will <b>not</b> be handled internally by 
	Synchronet or by a Global Hot Key Event. 

	To disable internal handling of the <i>Ctrl-C</i> key combination (for example)
	set this value to <b>8</b>. The value is determined by taking 2 to the power of
	the ASCII value of the control character (Ctrl-A is 1, Ctrl-B is 2, 
	etc.). In the case of Ctrl-C, taking 2 to the power of 3 equals 8. 

	To pass-through multiple control key combinations, multiple bits must be
	set (or'd together) to create the necessary value, which may require the
	use of a hexadecimal calculator. 

	If unsure, leave this value set to <b>0</b>, the default. </pre>
<h2><b><a name="LoadableModules">[2.6] - Loadable Modules</a>
</b></h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_loadablemods.png" width="572" height="331">

The Loadable Modules options are used for loading JavaScript (.js) or
Baja (.bin) modules during various stages of the BBS operation. Selecting
one of the functions will prompt you for the base filename of the module
(excluding the file extension - .js or .bin) to be used when that event
occurs. JavaScript (.js) modules take precedence over Baja (.bin) modules.

Following is a brief description of when each of the Loadable Modules occur
during the BBS operation:

<b>Login:</b>
	This module is <b>REQUIRED</b> for remote and local logins.  Occurs when a
	user is connected, immediately after the Synchronet copyright notice is
	displayed.

<b>Logon Event:
</b>	Occurs immediately after Login (above).

<b>Sync Event:
</b>	This is a Synchronization Event and occurs each time the BBS performs
	a node synchronization (e.g. when node messages are received, node
	status is read, etc...basically continuously while a user is online).

<b>Logoff Event:
</b>	Occurs ONLY when a user does a slow logoff.  Does NOT occur when users
	hang up on the BBS or do a fast logoff.

<b>Logout Event:
</b>	This is an offline event that occurs after a user has disconnected from
	the BBS, either by logging off or hanging up.

<b>New User Event:
</b>	Occurs at the end of a new user procedure (e.g. after the user has
	logged on, left new user feedback, and anything else that is
	required of a new user).

<b>Expired User:
</b>	This is an offline event that occurs during Synchronet's internal daily
	event (after the first caller at the beginning of a new day).</pre>
<h2><b><a name="SecurityValues">[2.7] - </a> </b><a name="SecurityValues"><b>Security 
Level Values</b></a></h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_securityvalues.png" width="572" height="331"></pre>
<pre>This option allows you to define the operating parameters of the Security Levels (0-99).
Selecting the desired security level will bring you to another menu similar to
the following:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_securityvalues_0.png" width="572" height="331"></pre>
<pre>Here you can modify the corresponding values for that particular security
level.	These values will be given to ALL users who have the selected security
level.	Many of these values may be overridden by giving certain users the
necessary exemptions (if required).  For example, the 'T' exemption will exempt
a user from any <i>time</i> limitations.</pre>
<h2><b><a name="ExpiredAccountValues">[2.8] - </a> </b><a name="ExpiredAccountValues"><b>Expired Account Values</b></a>
</h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_expired.png" width="572" height="331">

This sub-menu contains the account values for expired user accounts. When
a user account expires, the information contained here will be applied to
that user account.</pre>
<h2><b><a name="QuickValidationValues">[2.9] - </a> </b><a name="QuickValidationValues"><b>Quick Validation Values</b></a></h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_quickval.png" width="572" height="331">

This is where you define the values of the quick-validation sets (0-9).
Selecting a level from this list will bring you to another menu similar to the
following:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_system_quickval_0.png" width="572" height="331">

These are used to quickly set a user's Level, Flags, Restrictions and
Exemptions, as well as extend their expiration date and add credits to their
account.  A user can be quick-validated with the 'V' command from the 
Telnet/RLogin-based User Editor.</pre>
<h2><b><a name="CreatingUserAccountsLocally">[2.10] - </a> </b><a name="CreatingUserAccountsLocally"><b>
Creating User Accounts</b></a></h2>
<pre>Users may be created using one of the available user editors or by logging
on as &quot;new&quot; via Telnet or RLogin.</pre>
<h3><b><a name="CreatingSysopAccount">[2.10.1] - </a> </b><a name="CreatingSysopAccount"><b>Creating a Sysop Account</b></a></h3>
<pre>The first user account created (via Telnet or RLogin) will automatically be
given Sysop-level access (e.g. Security level 90, all flags and all exemptions).
For this reason, the System Password is prompted for (with the <b>SY:</b> prompt)
during the first new user creation process.</pre>
<pre>The sysop account is traditionally the first user record in the database
(i.e. user #1). This user account <b>should not</b> have the alias of <i>Sysop</i> - use your
real name or a handle instead. Synchronet automatically treats the alias of
<i>Sysop</i> special and forwards any mail received for &quot;Sysop&quot; to user #1.</pre>
<h3><b><a name="CreatingGuestAccount">[2.10.2] - </a> </b><a name="CreatingGuestAccount"><b>Creating a Guest Account</b></a></h3>
<pre>During the default Telnet/RLogin logon process, the sysop user account will
be prompted whether to create a &quot;Guest&quot; account or not (via the exec/makeguest.js
module). It is recommended that you answer &quot;Yes&quot; to create a Guest account.
This will allow anonymous FTP logins as well as &quot;read only&quot; access to your
other servers and services which encourage users to experience your BBS without
requiring them to create a user account first.</pre>
<pre>The sysop account's Security Flag 4G is used by the default logon module
(exec/logon.js) to determine whether or not to prompt the sysop to create the
Guest account.  If you answered &quot;No&quot; to the create Guest and &quot;Ask again later?&quot;
prompts, you can either run the makeguest.js module manually, or restore the 4G
security flag to the sysop account to be prompted during the next logon.</pre>
