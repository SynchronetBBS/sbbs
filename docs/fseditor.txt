A few notes on keybindings:
---------------------------
I am not completely opposed to changing some keybindings.  However, the current
ones fall into three catagories:
1) "Keepers" ones that I like and would need a very good reason to change.
2) "Lukewarm" ones I understand but don't particularily like very much.
3) "Changers" ones I would change in a heartbeat if I had an alternative.

The breakdown is as follows:
Keepers:  ABCEFGHIJLMRWZ
Lukewarm: OPVY
Changers: QU_

The reason X and Y are in lukewarm instead of changers is that PgUp/PgDn should
be both close together and enterable with one hand in my opinion.

The following CTRL keys are currently unused: DKNPSTX\

CTRL-Q and CTRL-S I do *not* want to use without alternates as they are the
Xon/Xoff chars used in flow control and are sometimes impossible to send from
a terminal.

I am open to suggestions.
