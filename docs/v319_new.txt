DIZ enhancements: Read/use SAUCE data, support ANSI, increase max 1->4K

Inspired by Blocktronics (and other ANSI art group) packs' FILE_ID.DIZ/ANS
files:
* Support (and prioritize) FILE_ID.ANS
* Convert ANSI color/attribute sequences in DIZ files to Ctrl-A equivalent
(uses SAUCE width and ICE color, if specified)
* Don't treat DIZ as a series of lines, they're not always nowadays.
* New putmsg() mode: P_INDENT to print files indented by current column
* Display full (up to 64-char) filenames in lists when using 132+ column
terminal.
* Use the Author, Group, and Title fields from the SAUCE if present/non-blank

Allow sysop to configure new user gender options (not just M/F)

The default choice/configuration is now: "M/F/X" (not just "M/F")
New @-code: GENDERS
text.dat EnterYourSex -> EnterYourGender

Add support for "name@address" syntax in twitlist.cfg

Security
~~~~~~~~
o Give sysop more control over characters allowed in uploaded filenames
  
JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~
o Added 'user' properties: birthyear, birthmonth, and birthday
o Added 'system.text()' method: like bbs.text()
o More control over console output streams (-A and -S options)
New JS User.stats properties:
- read_mail_waiting
- unread_mail_waiting
- spam_waiting
New FileBase class
New Archive class
New JS system properties: git_hash and git_branch
Add edit_msg() and forward_msg() methods to JS 'bbs' object
Expose the next-run-date/time for an event as a new `next_run` property
for `xtrn_area.event[]` (in `time_t` format) for easier debugging of these
kinds of issues.
Also expose the error log level as a new property: `error_level` while we're
here.
File.iniGetValue(), iniGetKeys(), iniGetObjects() no supported nested
(!include'd) .ini files
'jsexec -r<expression>' to evaluate a JS expression from command-line
New bbs.view_file(filename) method
Add bbs.export_filelist() method
Add BBS property: msg_from_bbsid

Exposes the FTN BBSID value from the message header (if there is one).

Fix: can_* and is_* properties were not dynamic. Added "files" property.

The following properties would only reflect the status at the time the
file_area object was initialized:
    - can_access
    - can_upload
    - can_download
    - is_operator
    - is_exempt

 ... so if changes were made the user while online, for example, these property
values would *not* also change to reflect the current state.

The lib[] and lib_list[] 'can_access' properties still have this flaw.

Also: Add a new "files" property to the dir[] and dir_list[] objects to report
the current number of files in each directory database.

Fix: can_* and is_* properties were not dynamic. Added "posts" property.

The following properties would only reflect the status at the time the
msg_area object was initialized:
- can_access
- can_read
- can_post
- is_operator
- is_moderated

... so if changes were made the user while online, for example, these
property values would *not* also change to reflect the current state.

The grp[] and grp_list[] 'can_access' properties still have this flaw.

Also: Add a new "posts" property to the sub[] and sub_list[] objects to
report the current number of posted messages (quicker than opening a MsgBase
instance).

o Signal the sub-board's configured semaphore file when importing echomail
