General
~~~~~~~
o New file base format (based on SMB), see docs/newfilebase.txt
  - supports long filenames
  - better support for files > 2GB and 4GB
  - extended file descriptions up to 4000 chars are now supported
  - supports file tags (specified by uploader, optionally, per directory)
  - stores and reports MD5 and SHA1 hash of files
DIZ enhancements: Read/use SAUCE data, support ANSI, increase max 1->4K
Inspired by Blocktronics (and other ANSI art group) packs' FILE_ID.DIZ/ANS
files:
  - Support (and prioritize) FILE_ID.ANS
  - Convert ANSI color/attribute sequences in DIZ files to Ctrl-A equivalent
    (uses SAUCE width and ICE color, if specified)
  - Don't treat DIZ as a series of lines, they're not always nowadays.
  - New putmsg() mode: P_INDENT to print files indented by current column
  - Display full (up to 64-char) filenames in lists when using 132+ column
    terminal.
  - Use the Author, Group, and Title fields from the SAUCE if present/non-blank
o libarchive integration (into SBBS and SBBSecho)
  built-in support for creating/extracting zip, 7zip, and tgz files
  additional read-only formats: rar, lha/lzh, iso, xar, and cab
o Give sysop more control over characters allowed in uploaded filenames
o Recognize the "standard" USENET signature delimiter: "\n-- \n"
o Use Linux OFD locks on 64-bit Linux builds
o Use a more-liberal username matching algorithm
  e.g. Ignore all non-trailing non-alphanumeric characters
o Support for single-part MIME-attachment decode/download
o .ini file !include now supports wildcard patterns
   e.g .!include modopts.d/*.ini
o Support for "name@address" syntax in twitlist.cfg
  
JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~
o Added 'user' properties: birthyear, birthmonth, and birthday
o Added 'system.text()' method: similar to bbs.text()
o New JS User.stats properties:
- read_mail_waiting
- unread_mail_waiting
- spam_waiting
o New FileBase class
o New Archive class
o New JS system properties: git_hash and git_branch
o Add edit_msg() and forward_msg() methods to JS 'bbs' object
o Expose the next-run-date/time for an event as a new `next_run` property
  for `xtrn_area.event[]` (in `time_t` format) for easier debugging of these
  kinds of issues
o File.iniGetValue(), iniGetKeys(), iniGetObjects() now supported nested
  (!include'd) .ini files
o 'jsexec -r<expression>' to evaluate a JS expression from command-line
o More control over jsexec console output streams (-A and -S options)
o New bbs.view_file(filename) method
o Add bbs.export_filelist() method
o Add bbs.msg_from_bbsid property

The following properties would only reflect the status at the time the
file_area object was initialized:
    - can_access
    - can_upload
    - can_download
    - is_operator
    - is_exempt

 ... so if changes were made the user while online, for example, these property
values would *not* also change to reflect the current state.

The lib[] and lib_list[] 'can_access' properties still have this flaw.

Also: Add a new "files" property to the dir[] and dir_list[] objects to report
the current number of files in each directory database.

The following properties would only reflect the status at the time the
msg_area object was initialized:
- can_access
- can_read
- can_post
- is_operator
- is_moderated

... so if changes were made the user while online, for example, these
property values would *not* also change to reflect the current state.

Also: Add a new "posts" property to the sub[] and sub_list[] objects to
report the current number of posted messages (quicker than opening a MsgBase
instance).
