    This causes transmitted CR/LF pairs to be interpretted as two
    separate characters (instead of one)

o Added support under Win9x/Me for "naughty" FOSSIL programs/doors
  - DOSXTRN.EXE now includes a 16-bit ISR stub for FOSSIL programs/doors

  - DOS/FOSSIL driver (SBBSEXEC.DLL) now yields time-slices for programs
    that poll for input (similar to how TAME operates)
  - No more 100% CPU usage from games like LORD, TradeWars, BRE, etc

o Improved disconnected-user detection while running DOS/FOSSIL doors
  - Periodic sending of telnet GA (go-ahead) command

***********************************************************
* What's New in Synchronet Version 3.10 Revision C (Beta) *
***********************************************************

Telnet Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o 0-byte QWK packets are now simply ignored rather than generating errors
  - It is assumed the file is still being downloaded by another process

o Configurable number of polls before yield for NT/2K/XP fossil driver
  - Allows tuning of multitasker TAME-like performance
  - Was previosly hard-coded to 10, values of 5000+ improve LORD and LORD IGM 
    RIP detection but increases CPU usage for BRE and possibly other doors

o Fixed old bug: anonymous uploads weren't flagged as anonymous unless the 
  entire directory was forced anonymous

o Fixed new bug: FidoNet echomail semaphore files weren't working

o Password display char is now configurable as the fourth character in the 
  last line of the text.dat - defaults to 'X' if not specified
  - third char is currently ignored but is reserved for for configurable
    "quit" character in the future (currently hard-coded to 'Q')

o When replying to mail, no longer prompts to delete message if message was 
  already flagged for deletion (caused unintential UN-deletion of message)

o Fixed Baja bugs: SYSOP_PAGE and GURU_PAGE functions set reversed logic state

o Improved internal chat page performance (random tones) - rarely used


JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~
o Improved Socket class 
  - last_error property is maintained on a per-instance basis

  not being reset if user was logged in during the date change (12 midnight)

o Fixed bug: logoff was setting timed-used-last-call to number of 'seconds'
  used rather than 'minutes'

o Implemented security considerations recommended in RFC2577:
  - Added a 5 second delay after each failed login attempt
  - Session is terminated after 3 failed login attempts
  - Port command supports ports >=1024 only, defeats "bounce attack"


Mail Server v1.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Updated mail-abuse.org DNS and HTTP server addresses 
  (for RBL/RSS/DUL SPAM rejection)

o Creates data/spam.log listing every rejected SPAM attempt

  (e.g. "Dr._Seuss" will match "Dr. Seuss")

o Sysop psuedonym matching is now performed in global matchuser function
  - Basically, anywhere a user name or number can be specified, "Sysop",
    "Postmaster", the configured sysop name (in SCFG) and the system's QWK
    ID will all be considered pseudonym's for user record #1

o Sped up getuserdat() significantly by eliminating call to lastuser->flength

o bbs.text() returns null on invalid index (instead of static string)

o Fixed a couple of bugs in Socket.recvline method:
  1. was incrementing buffer char pointer even when there was no new data
  2. was not releasing time-slices when there was no new data
  - This same fix was applied to the Baja SOCKET_READLINE function

o Socket recv, recvline, and peek methods now return null when there is a 
  time-out or no data (instead of an empty string)

Synchronet Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Services are TCP servers that are launched dynamically by Synchronet when an
  inbound connection is detected on a specific TCP port (ala Unix inetd)

o Services are normally written in JavaScript, but native (32-bit) services are
  also suppoorted 
  - Native services must be able to receive socket descriptor on command-line

o Stock "sample" services:
  - Finger (exec/fingerservice.js)
  - Gopher (exec/gopherservice.js)
  - HTTP/HTML node list (exec/nodelist-html.js)
  - NNTP, Network News Transfer Protocol (exec/nntpservice.js)

o Services are configured with ctrl/services.cfg

o The Finger service along with the SMTP telegram support creates a new 
  Inter-BBS "Instant Messaging" technology using standard Internet protocols

o Expect to see more standard Internet server protocols supported with 
  Synchronet services in the near future, as well as-yet-to-be-invented 
  technologies


Telnet Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o New finger client (exec/finger.js) launched with the [F]inger command from 
  the chat menu

o New Inter-BBS "Instant Messaging" module (exec/sbbsimsg.js) launched with the
  [I]nstant message command from the chat menu

o Increased delay after ANSI cursor position report (detection response) is 
  received
  - This increases the likelyhood of detecting RIPscrip support properly in
    RIPtel

o Non-QuickBBS/MSGTMP-sytle external editors now use the TEMP directory as the
  current directory and the location of the temporary message files 
  (for additional security)

o Added support for editing existing messages using QuickBBS/MSGINF-style 
  external editors

o Batch download programs can now use %s to represent the full list of files
  to be downloaded (required for Unix sb/sz support)

o Beautified the temp directory listing a bit

o Fixed a really old bug where you couldn't 'R'emove files from the temp dir

o Max QWK message limit now applies to Q-restricted accounts too

o Added new 'O' (QWK packet size) exemption

o Detailed log entries now include user's alias

o userlist will now sort up to 2500 users (previously limited to 1000)

o Changed wildcard use to be more Unix-like ("*" means all files)

o SEND/RECEIVE_FILE functions now use higher level protocol function 
  - prompt for hangup after transfer, handles log parsing, etc.

o @nopause@ and @poff@ codes now disable all pauses, even on screen clears

o New @-code:
  - UPTIME - System up-time in days, hours and minutes

o Fixed potential lock-up in getstr if input_thread is unexpectedly terminated

o inkey now recognizes and adheres to the K_UPPER mode bit

o getkey no longer asks if user is still there if cfg.sec_warn is equal to
  cfg.sec_hangup

o getkey releases time-slices when called with node offline or input_thread not
  running (just in case)

o Added optional date/time argument (%s) to ctrl/text.dat/AutoMsgBy (line 42)


Events
~~~~~~
o Added more event log output, especially concerning exclusive events

o Added one hour time-outs while waiting for exclusive events
  - prevents extended down-time waiting for an unresponsive node or event

o Removed redundant node_daily event execution at end of node_thread 
  - already handled in event_thread


Mail Server v1.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o POP3 server supports login by alias (from ctrl/alias.cfg)

o SMTP server now rejects mail if there is no body text

o Added ability to post on a sub-board via SMTP (sub:code@host)
  - best to use alias.cfg for this feature (e.g. "syncprog sub:syncprog")

o Support for receving SEND/SOML/SAML SMTP commands (which create telegrams)
  - used in new Inter-BBS "Instant Messaging" technology

o Set a hard maximum number of recipients in a given mail session 
  - currently 1000

o Added last_error strings to smb_getmsgtxt() error log entries for better 
  error reporting

o Added text/email.can and text/subject.can checking as sysop-configurable
  Spam filters

o Illegal relay attempts are now logged in the SPAM.LOG as Spam attempts

o SMTP server now supports messages missing the 'From' field 
  - uses MAIL FROM: return-path

o SMTP server supports external address aliases (you@somedomain.com = sysop) in
  the ctrl/alias.cfg file

o Original destination address is now stored in "name" field of message header


FTP Server v1.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Periodic transfer progress reports occur even when no data is transferring

o Progress report cps rates are now per-report rather than for total file

o If resuming a transfer, file offset is now shown in progress reports

~~~~~~~~
o Better dupe message detection/prevention using X-Gateway header field

o Better retainment of message-ids across gated message networks

o Better prevention of inadvertent gating (must have gate-between-net-types)

o Creates default (blank) properties for message header object:
  eliminates script errors when importing malformed message headers

o Added optional flags field to area lines in newslink.cfg
  Supported flags:
	n - don't add "from newsgroup" tag to imported message text

o print statements are now crlf-terminated for easier debugging with ;EXEC


nntpservice.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Many of the improvements made to newslink.js, also made in nntpservice.js

o Added support for the DATE command (RFC 2980)

o Uses message-id of posted msgs if sender is a slave server (not a client)

o Tracker1's modification to set the "to" field of posted messages based on
  the from field of the message referenced in "references" header field
  (if present)

JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~
o printf() and format() now convert floating point numbers to long (%ld)

o BBS timed events can now use User class

o Branch callbacks now collect garbage (free-up memory) every 100 calls
  - this fixes the problem of every created object living in memory during
    the life of a script causing a long-running script to eventually run 
    out of memory

o Fixed the following global methods (were corrupting passed string buffer):
  ascii_str(), strip_ctrl(), strip_exascii(), and truncsp()

o UDP (datagram) sockets are now supported by the Socket class

o New Socket class properties: local_ip_address, local_port,
  remote_ip_address, and remote_port

o Socket getoption() and setoption() methods no longer have the option "level"
  as an argument and the option name is now specified as a string (the numeric
  values defined in sockdefs.js are not cross-platform)

o Fixed Socket is_connected property value (was true before connect)

o Changed Socket recv, recvline, and peek methods to support unlimited buffer
  lengths

o Fixed bug in bbs.replace_text() method when called with empty string ("")

o New bbs properties: msg_id, msg_reply_id, smb_msgs, and smb_curmsg

o New console method: ansi_getxy() to get terminal's current cursor location

o New console method: lock_input() to lock/unlock the input_thread allowing
  direct client.socket read calls from scripts

o system.spamlog() now takes an "action" parameter
  - usage: spamlog(prot, action, reason, host, ip_addr, to);

o Fixed memory leaks in MsgBase class

o MsgBase save_msg() and put_msg_header() methods now parse the header 
  object's id and reply_id properties and place them in the appropriate SMB 
  header fields

o MsgBase get_msg_header() method defines only the following properties as 
  read only: number, id, and reply_id 
  - the rest are now read/write

o MsgBase get_msg_body and get_msg_tail methods now take additional bool
  parameter indicating whether the message is to be rfc822-encoded or not
  (defaults to false)
  - this solves the problem of the nntp service and newslink module sending
    messages with dots in the first character of a line incorrectly

o Added MsgBase ftn_msgid, ftn_reply, ftn_pid, ftn_area, and ftn_flags
  FidoNet msg header properties

o MsgBase msg hdr reply_id based on time and number of original message
  - reply_id property is not created if it doesn't exist in the msg header
  - msg.id is based on the time the message was imported rather than written

o Fixed MsgBase subject, to, and from CRCs in message base index
  - threading on author, to, or subject didn't work on imported msgs

o Added support for MsgBase msg hdr USENET Path and Newsgroups header fields

o New system toggle options (SCFG->System->Toggle Options) to suppress
  hard-coded displays (system info and active node list) during logon

o New MSGID and REPLY kludge lines in QWK networked messages
  - allows cross-network threading based on message-id

o Added new command (E) to allow users to edit their posted messages on a
  specific sub-board (sysop configurable in SCFG)

o Implemented support for SUB_DELLAST toggle option
  - allows deleting of last message only
  - option has been in SCFG for a long time, but never implemented

o Fixed chat channel 0 (sysop broadcast channel) bugs related to chat actions

o Auto-initializes SBBSDATA and SBBSEXEC convenience environment variables
  for use in external programs/batch files/shell scripts

o Sets socket mode back to blocking after running external programs
  - fix for external programs that change the socket's blocking mode

o If the menu file text/menu/xtrn/code.* exists (where code is the external
  program's internal code), the file will be displayed to the user before the
  door is run

o New @-codes: MSG_NUM, MSG_ID, MSG_REPLY_ID, SMB_MSGS, SMB_CURMSG, 
  SMB_LAST_MSG, SMB_MAX_MSGS, SMB_MAX_CRCS, SMB_MAX_AGE, and SMB_TOTAL_MSGS

o Updated old msg group and sub-board name/number @-codes to use currently
  open message base details, if applicable


SBBSecho
~~~~~~~~
o New option (in ECHOCFG) to strip linefeeds from exported messages
  - Previously, it *always* stripped linefeeds causing formatting problems
    with some non-comforming echomail programs (defaults to "Off")


Mail Server
~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added support to SMTP server for "forward:" and "local:" address prefixes,
  allowing sender-control of forwarding to external mail addresses

o Created generic DNS blacklist support via optional configuration file:
  ctrl/dns_blacklist.cfg - allows multipe RBL-style DNS blacklists

o The hardcoded RBL functionality has been replaced with dns_blacklist.cfg

o Added support for ctrl/dnsbl_exempt.cfg to exempt a list of IPs 
  (or IP masks) from DNSBL testing

o Three new options on handling of mail from DNSBL-listed servers:
  A. refuse sesion (used to be only choice)
  B. refuse mail (e.g. report "bad address")
  C. ignore mail (e.g. pretend to receive)
  D. receive mail, but tag msg subject and header with configurable tags

o Now logs DNS query result (e.g. 127.0.0.2) from DNS-based Blacklist servers

o Changed DNS blacklist reject error code from 571 to 550

o POP3 server allows up to three non-USER commands in authentication state
  i.e. ignores "CAPA" command (RFC 2449)

o Better support for outbound addresses with both "name" and <addr> portions

o User class constructor can be called with no arguments
  - creates a User object representing no existing user
  - number property must be set before any changes can be saved

o Global load() method can now (optionally) take additional arguments which
  are then used to change the values of the global argv and argc properties
  Example: load("myscript.js", arg1, arg2);

o New global truncstr(str,set) method, truncates a given string at the first
  occurance of any char in set (ala strpbrk), returns the truncated string

o New methods: system.put_node_message() and system.put_telegram()
  - same as bbs methods by the same name but can be called from other servers

o New method: system.new_user(alias)
  - returns User object representing a new user record

o New method: system.matchuserdata(field, data, [usernumber]) 
  - searches for an exact string match of any user record data field and
    returns the number of the first matching user

o File.open() method now accepts an additional, optional bool argument:
  shareable (defaults to false)
  - if a file is opened as 'shareable', then simultaneous opens will be
    allowed (no file locking), otherwise, the file is locked according the
    open 'mode'

  - currently only includes online external programs (doors)
  - will add timed events, external editors, etc. later
  - sorry Rocko, couldn't wait for your version :-)

o MsgBase class:
  Fixed case sensitivity problem with opening message bases on Unix
  Added support for hdr.from_org (Organization) header field
  Imports and exports SMTP reverse_path header field (hdr.reverse_path)

  - doesn't exist for "mail" message base

o MsgBase.save_msg():
  USENETPATH headers are no longer *always* added to newly saved messages
  It's up to another application (e.g. nntpservice.js) to add the local system
  to the path
  Added support for importing message headers with replyto header fields

o Fixed bug in Socket.poll() - timeout value only worked as first argument

o Fixed memory leak in Socket.sendfile() if file read failed

o New Socket.recvfrom() method that returns an object with 3 properties:
  data, ip_address, and port (for UDP responses to broadcasted requests)

o Socket.connect() call is no longer needed for UDP sockets

o Socket.local_port and remote_port properties are now numbers
  (instead of strings)

o New property Socket.type, set to SOCK_STREAM (TCP) or SOCK_DGRAM (UDP)
  when the socket is created (read-only)
  - SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM are defined in exec/sockdefs.js

o Fixed bug in Socket.bind() if port number specified (byte-order fix)

o Port arguments in Socket.bind(), connect() and sendto() can now be
  specified as a service name (e.g. "telnet", "http", "finger", etc).

  accepts optional 'backlog' argument (defaults to 1)

o New Socket.accept() method, accepts an inbound TCP connection,
  returns a newly created socket object

o Socket.poll() method now accepts an additional, optional argument: 
  bool poll_for_write, defaults to false (poll for read)


SCFG (Configuration Utility)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added optional parent directory to file library configuration
  - used to specify a physical parent directory for all logical directories
    in a file library (convenient for importing CD-ROM directories)
  - requires v3 of ADDFILES and FILELIST utilities

o Support for importing "raw" directory listings (containing just dir names)
  - for use in conjunction with the new "parent directory" option

o User signatures can now be disabled on a per sub-board basis

o New option to create lowercase drop file names for external programs
  (for better Unix file system compatibility)

o Exports and imports newsgroup name as part of subs.txt format

o Fixed bug that could occur if new user command shell was set to last
  configured command shell, and that shell was later deleted


Telnet Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o All ctrl-keys (built-ins and hot-key events) use same the recursion 
  protection mechanism now limiting them to a total maximum depth of 2
  - solves re-entrancy issues for hot-key events

o DEL (ASCII 127) is treated the same as backspace (ASCII 8) in string
  input routines

o When importing QWK and REP network packets, the corresponding
  data/qnet/<id>.in is only created when necessary

o Unix-build creates external program (door) drop-files with CRLF-deliminated
  lines if not configured as 32-bit native
  - for DOSEMU/DOSCMD compatibility

o trashcan() now delays 500 milliseconds after displaying the optional
  text/bad*.msg file 
  - gives time for transmit buffer to clear before disconnecting

o Fixed exception during termination of bbs_thread if subs/dirs were added in
  SCFG and the confg files were re-loaded (node(s) recycled) before shutdown

o Baja FTP function fixes:
  - Removed extra crlf sent with FTP PASS command
  - Fixed bug causing intermittent bind failures on FreeBSD
  - Fixed active (non-PASV) mode file transfers

o FOSSIL driver for NT-based operating systems (sbbsexec.dll) now reports
  I/O buffer fullness more accurately
  - fixes problem with FDSZ sending entire file then timing out while waiting
    for acknowledgement from client

o One-byte-at-time external programs (e.g. LORD) should preform better on
  NT-based operating systems due to better interprocess communication

o When debugging (logging) received telnet commands, sent commands are now
  logged too

o QWKnet kludge line lengths up to 500 chars now supported
  - previously limited to 128 chars

o Fixed bug that would change user #1's QWK settings when importing QWKnet
  packets

ADDFILES
~~~~~~~~
o Several bugs fixed since last 3.00 beta releases


FILELIST
~~~~~~~~
o New version 3.00 port (for Win32 and Unix)


SMBUTIL
~~~~~~~
o Messages posted via SMBUTIL now have the SENDERAGENT field set to
  AGENT_SMBUTIL to prevent the Synchronet mail server (or other programs)
  from bouncing undeliverable messages back to a "process"

o Improved packmsgs() handling of failed deletion/renaming of temp files
  (occurs if the msgbase is open by another process at the time of packing)
  - the msgbase should no longer be left in a corrupted state if this occurs

o Cosmetic changes to header dump routine

o Creates a FIDOPID (program identifier) header field when storing messages

o New command-line option (-d) to set default values for header fields
  (to, from, from_number, and subject) when importing messages


CHKSMB
~~~~~~
o Now verifies header lengths match calculated header lengths

o Displays more detail regarding corrupted data field offsets when used 
  with the -e switch


SBBSecho
~~~~~~~~
o Bugfix: FLO files were being truncated rather than appended

o No longer writes the same (duplicate) bundle name to the FLO file if it's
  already listed

o Now deletes BUNDLES.SBE when no longer needed (rather than truncate it)
  - hopefully eliminates FAQs about this file

o OS/2 builds now available again (thanks Watcom!)

o Now imports and exports TZUTC, MSGID, REPLYID, PID, and TID control fields

o Sets "when written" time zone on imported messages based on TZUTC or
  TZUTCINFO kludge lines, if present

o Tosser ID (TID) fields are created if it doesn't already exist

o Fixed the creation of inter-zone outbound point directories for FLO mailers

o Fixed importation of FLAGS ctrl line (was looking for "FLAGS:" not "FLAGS")

o FLAGS and unrecognized kludge lines are now added to exported messages

o Line feeds are ignored when converting non-ASCII chars for ASCII-only subs

o Fixed case of mail message base (for Unix file systems)


Services
~~~~~~~~
o Support for new "static" services
  - services that listen on a socket and accept their own connections/clients
  - requires option bit 1 (0x2) set in ctrl/services.cfg file

o New global write() and writeln() methods to make it consistent with FTP and
  Web server global methods used to generate html (e.g. nodelist-html.js)


Mail Server
~~~~~~~~~~~
o Uses hostname instead of inetaddr (usually the same) in SMTP cmds/responses
  and SMTP "Received" headers

o Support for sender addresses that include comments (in parenthesis)

o Increased read timeout from from 1 to 5 minutes

o POP3 server actually checks the number of lines sent successfully and only
  marks the message as 'read' if all lines requested were sent successfully

o Now stores original, unmodified RFC822: to, from, and reply-to header fields

o Bounce-messages are now flagged as from AGENT_SMTPSYSMSG and messages from
  processes aren't bounced (preventing bounced message loops)

o Reduced mail server cycle time from 5 to 2 seconds (frequency at which
  recycle semaphores are checked)

o Added option to toggle logging of received responses (DEBUG_RX_RSP)

o Much improved message bouncing:
  - delivery failure (bounce) messages now includes error details
  - error message text is no longer crammed into the bounce-message subject
  - the original subject is retained
  - fixed bug that could cause corruption after original message deletion
  - use of original reverse-path for bounced message delivery


FTP Server
~~~~~~~~~~
o Improved string bounds checking

o Fixed bug with continuous recycling

o Now (optionally) echoes password attempt for unknown users

o Increased select timeouts (from 1 to 5 minutes)

o Increased recycle semaphore check frequency (from 5 to 2 seconds)

o The reported "unix" file and directory modes more closely reflect
  the actual read/write permissions (FTP clients should ignore them anyway)

o Added support for resumed uploads (using APPE or REST commands)

o Fixed time display of files in local directory listings

o CWD's to paths with trailing filenames now fail (as they should) 
  - when IE fails to download a file, it attempts to CWD to the path, and if 
    the CWD succeeds the subsequent requested paths were all wrong


***********************************************************
* What's New in Synchronet Version 3.10 Revision L (Beta) *
***********************************************************

General
~~~~~~~
o Timed events can be configured to run only on specific days of the month
  (example: the 1st and 15th of every month)

o Eliminated harmless accept/select errors when shutting down servers

o Win32 build now uses Critical Sections in place of Mutexes
  - Mutexe API routines are slower because they must enter the kernel

o Now using thread-safe time functions in Unix builds

o Now using thread-safe "real path" function in OpenBSD build

o New command-line utility (makeuser) to add a user to the user database
  - run makeuser -? for usage instructions

o Node window in SBBSCTRL no longer unnecessarily locks node.dab
  - eliminates locking/reading errors

o QWK Bugfix: was always truncating MESSAGES.DAT, so appending to an existing
  QWK packet (pre-packed or aborted download) did not work at all (ever)
  - this also resulted in a side-effect of corrupted indexes (if enabled)

o Beautified and sped-up (immensely) the unpacking of QWK network message 
  packets

o New optional ctrl/twitlist.cfg file contains, names (with wildcards) of
  users/authors whose posts will not be imported from QWK or FidoNet networks

o Configurable directory for modified modules/scripts

o Configurable directory for log files

o Message sub-board and file directory internal codes can now be extended to
  16 characters by using the new optional message group/file library 
  "internal code prefix" - this feature allows sysops to easy create message
  and file areas with unique (non-conflicting) internal codes

o Download notifications can now be disabled on a per-directory basis

o New cross-platform graphical user interface (based on FLTK) for SCFG and
  ECHOCFG (run with "-g" to enable GUI interface)

o New Unix installer - installs and builds source code from CVS or tgz files
  - thank Deuce for this neat-o program

o All TCP servers individually track and log the number of clients served

o All TCP servers now detect and log client hostname aliases (canonical names)

o Bugfix: TCP server's up-time root value is reset if the server thread is 
  shutdown and restarted (excluding recycles)


Control Panel (Win32 GUI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Bugfix: Configuration Wizard no longer fails to save configuration files
  if there is no existing mail message database (data/mail.*)

o Servers are recycled/refreshed after completing Configuration Wizard

o Fixed DNS Server address detection on systems with multiple NICs

o File->Import/Export Settings menu options now prompt for path/filename

  ExternalTermANSI and ExternalTermDumb


Telnet Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o System password is now required to create the first user (sysop) account

o Fixed problem detecting number of rows for Windows 2K/XP telnet client 
  (was reporting 105 lines when used in a scrollable window)
  - fixed by Deuce

o Screen-lines are no longer auto-detected (for ANSI terminals) at every
  "default config" menu prompt, but rather only when using the "Screen Length"
  option and selecting "Auto Detect"
  - solves problem with terminals that don't respond properly to the ANSI
    cursor position request

o Ctrl-C now purges both input and output buffers (when appropriate)

o Built-in ctrl key handling (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-T, Ctrl-U, etc) can be disabled
  with SCFG->System->Advanced->Control Key Pass-through
  - any keys specified in this bit-map will not be handled internally or by
    global hot key events

o New toggle option for external programs, events, and message editors:
  - use Shell to Execute, forces command-line to be executed via system
    command shell (e.g. cmd.exe, bash/sh, etc.)

o The periodic sending of Telnet Go-Ahead commands can now be disabled
  - This feature is useful for quickly detecting dropped connections
  - Unfortunately, some Telnet clients print/echo the Telnet GA command

o Now sends Telnet DO/WILL BINARY TRANSMIT commands before file transfers
  - Fixes problem with some Unix telnet clients that don't do this themselves

o ctrl/attr.cfg now support lower-case attribute character codes

o Improved server shutdown detection in node threads

o Short (single line) error log entry now includes last Win32 error value

o Displays external netmail address before prompting to forward local mail

o The 'F'ind text command while reading messages can now either show message
  headers only or entire text

o Bugfix: files with on extension in filebase would corrupt listing display

o Optional text/menu/msgtabs.* menu, displayed as the "tab bar" in the
  internal editor instead of the hard-coded tab bar

o New FREESPACEK @-code to display free disk space in kilobytes

o New SERVED @-code to report the number of clients served since started

o Bugfix: telnet gateway now handles temporarily blocked sockets (retries)

o Bugfix: occasional attribute mismatch when restoring saved line with ANSI

o %s command-line specifier now represents the configured start-up directory
  when used in online external program (door) and timed event command lines
  - This is actually a cross-platform compatibility fix for Unix systems
    where '.' is not in the current search path

o New default modules: newuser.js and logon.js to replace Baja equivalents
  - newuser.js optionally sends welcome e-mail to new users
  - logon.js prompts sysop to create guest account (calls makeguest.js)

o New chkspace.js event module to check free disk space and e-mail warning
  to sysop when low


JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~
o Increased the default JavaScript heap size to 8MB

o JavaScript heap size is configurable
  - JavaScriptMaxBytes key in the [Global] section of the sbbs.ini file
  - SBBSCTRL:File->Properties->Advanced->JavaScript Heap

o console.attributes can now be set with an attribute string
  (Ctrl-A codes without the Ctrl-A escape characters)

o New property: console.ctrlkey_passthru, bit-map specifying which control
  keys will not be handled internally or by global hot key events

o New array, console.color_list[] contains sysop-configured attributes from
  ctrl/attr.cfg (which can now be extended with additional color definitions)

o Timed events now have access to user objects (msg_area, file_area, etc)

o Fixed MsgBase.put_msg_header() - no longer creates duplicate header fields

o MsgBase.get/put msg header/body/tail functions can now access messages
  via message ID (rather than by offset or message number)

o system.spamlog() now takes additional 'from' parameter (typically the SMTP
  reverse-path)

o New system.freediskspacek property - free disk space in kilobytes

o New system.logs_dir and system.mods_dir properties

o Socket poll() method accepts a floating point timeout for fractional timeout
  values

o bbs.sub_info() and dir_info methods now accept optional sub/dir argument

o All bbs methods that accept sub/dir argument will now default to current sub
  or dir if not specified

o New properties: bbs.batch_upload_total and bbs.batch_dnload_total
