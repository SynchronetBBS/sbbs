<h2><u>[3.0] - <a name="Adding Nodes">Adding Nodes</a></u></h2>
<pre>Run SCFG from your NODE1 directory. Select Nodes from the main menu. Hit INS
(insert key) to create additional nodes (up to your Node license limit plus
one additional local only node). Each added node will have the configuration
options copied from the last node. Make any configuration changes (including
modem/com port configuration) necessary.

Exit SCFG. Copy *.BAT from your NODE1 directory into each added node directory.</pre>
<h2><u>[3.1] - </u><a name="Configuring Nodes"><u>Configuring Nodes</u></a></h2>
<pre>You can configure any node from within SCFG regardless of what computer
(or virtual computer) you're using. To configure a node, select &quot;Nodes&quot; from
the SCFG &quot;Configure&quot; menu. You will then see a list of all the nodes installed
on your system. You will also see the bottom line of the screen now has two
additional key commands added, INS and DEL. INS and DEL are used to add and
delete nodes from the system. If you select one of the nodes listed, you will
receive another menu as follows:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_node1.gif" width="652" height="331"></pre>
<pre>We will now discuss the options of this menu.

<b>Name:</b>
        This is the name of the node. This parameter is not used for anything
        but documentary purposes in the BBS.

<b>Phone Number:
</b>        This is the phone number of this node in the format AAA-EEE-NNNN.

<b>Logon Prompt:
</b>        This is what will be displayed to callers after the Synchronet version
        and registration number, but before the NN: prompt.</pre>
<pre><b>Minimum Connect Rate:
</b>        This is the minimum modem connection rate that will be allowed. Callers
        can still connect and attempt to logon, but without the 'M' exemption,
        they will be told what minimum connect rate is and disconnected.

<b>Logon Requirements:
</b>        Use this option to set specific requiremenets to logon this node.

<b>Local Text Editor:
</b>        This is the command line to use when editing text files or messages
        locally. This command line is not used when posting or sending e-mail
        unless the above option is set to 'Yes'. If this option is not
        specified, the default editor for the current user will be used. An
        example (using Qedit as the editor) would be:
        <b>q.exe %f</b>

        Assuming <b><i>Q.EXE</i></b> is in the DOS search path. If it isn't, you can specify
        the location of the program. Example:
        <b>c:\qedit\q.exe %f</b>

        The <b>%f</b> parameter will expand to the path and filename of the file to
        edit.

<b>Text Viewer:</b>
        This is the command line to use to view text files locally. Currently,
        this command line is only used to view the system log files. You should
        use a program that allows the text scrolling up and down as well as
        string searches. A popular program for this use is Buerg's LIST.
        If you are running multiple nodes and the program you wish to use
        leaves the file open while viewing, you should use a batch file that
        actual copies the file to view and then views the copy.
        Example (if program name is LIST):
        LISTIT.BAT:</pre>
<blockquote>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" width="70%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">
        <pre>@echo off
copy %1 list.tmp
list list.tmp
del list.tmp</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<pre>        An example for this field (using the LISTIT batch file) would be:
        <b>%!listit.bat %f</b>

        The <b>%!</b> parameter specifies that the batch file is located in the
        EXEC directory. If is not located there, you can remove the <b>%!</b> so that
        the DOS search path will be searched for the batch file or specify
        its location.

        The <b>%f</b> parameter will expand to the path and filename of the file to
        view.</pre>
<pre><b>Configuration Command:
</b>	This is the command line to use to execute the Synchronet configuration
	program from the WFC screen. The simplest command line to use is &quot;SCFG&quot;
	(this will execute SCFG.BAT or SCFG.CMD from the current node
	directory). Alternate command lines:

	If this node is running Synchronet for DOS:

<b>		%!scfg %k /t%w
</b>
		This command lines has the added advantage of passing the
		timeslice configuration of the current node (enabling Win/OS2
		idle API calls or disabling DESQview/DOS idle API calls).
		This flavor of SCFG supports user mouse control.
		This flavor of SCFG can only use conventional DOS memory for
		configuration items (EMS is automatically used, if available,
		for executable overlay caching - improving performance but
		not increasing the maximum number of configured items).

	To use the extended-DOS/Win32 version of SCFG:

<b>		%!scfg32 %k
</b>
		This flavor of SCFG can access all of your installed memory
		(no memory limitations under Win32).
		This flavor of SCFG does not support any timeslice API calls
		(may consume more timeslices than necessary when run under a
		non-Win32 multitasking environment).

	If this node is running Synchronet for OS/2:

<b>		%!scfg4os2 %k
</b>
		This flavor of SCFG has no memory limitations.

<b>DOS Command Interpreter:
</b>	If this node is running Synchronet for OS/2, this is the path to your
	command interpreter for OS/2 virtual DOS machines. Example:

<b>		C:\OS2\MDOS\COMMAND.COM
</b>
	This option is only used when running Synchronet for OS/2.</pre>
<h2><u>[3.2] - </u><a name="Node Toggle Options"><u>Node Toggle Options</u></a></h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_node1_toggles.gif" width="652" height="331">

<b>Alarm When Answering:</b>
        If you would like have the BBS sound an alarm when answering the phone,
        set this option to Yes.

<b>Status Screen While WFC:
</b>        This node will display a screen with system usage statistics and the
        current status of all active nodes.

<b>Total Msgs/Files While WFC:
</b>	If you have the system statistics displayed while WFC, and you wish to
	include the total number of messages and files in the display, set this
	option to Yes. The retrieval of statistics is faster when set to No.

<b>Use Editor for Messages:
</b>        If this option is set to 'Yes' and you have specified a Local Text
        Editor (next option), when logged on locally this editor will be used
        for the creation of all messages.

<b>Use EMS for Overlays:
</b>	Set this option to 'Yes' to have this node to use EMS memory for
	overlay files. Setting this option to 'Yes' can help increase the
	performance of the BBS significantly if enough EMS memory is available
	(about 360K).

<b>Allow Swapping:
</b>	Set this option to 'Yes' to allow this node to swap when necessary.
	If you do not have EMS, XMS, or Extended memory available, and you
	do not wish to have Synchronet swap to disk, you should set this
	option to 'No'.

<b>Swap to EMS:
</b>	When set to 'Yes', Synchronet will attempt to swap to EMS memory when
	executing a program that is in your &quot;Global Swap List&quot;.

<b>Swap to XMS:
</b>	When set to 'Yes', Synchronet will attempt to swap to XMS memory.

<b>Swap to Extended Memory:
</b>	When set to 'Yes', Synchronet will attempt to swap to Extended memory.
	This option should always bet set to 'No' when running under a DOS
	multitasker.

<b>Windows/OS2 Time Slice API:
</b>	Set this option to 'Yes' if you are running Synchronet under OS/2.
	You may experience poor performance if this option is set to 'Yes'
	and you are running Synchronet under Microsoft Windows v3.x. If this
	occurs, set this option to 'No'.

<b>DESQview Time Slice API:
</b>	Set this option to 'Yes' if you are running Synchronet using DESQview.
	Since Synchronet auto-detects DESQview it will not hurt anything to
	leave this option set to 'Yes' if you are not running DESQview.

<b>DOS Idle Interrupts:
</b>	This option defaults to 'Yes'. You should not change this setting.

<b>Low Priority String Input:
</b>	Normally Synchronet does not give up timeslices under multitaskers
	when waiting for string input from the user.  Setting this option to
	'Yes' will for Synchronet to give up timeslices when waiting for
	string input, this may cause &quot;jerky&quot; keyboard response but will
	improve overall system performance under multitaskers.

<b>Allow Logon by Number:
</b>	Setting this option to 'Yes' will allow users to logon by typing their
	user number at the 'NN:' logon prompt.

<b>Allow Logon by Real Name:
</b>	When set to 'Yes' this option allows users to enter their real name
	(or company name) at the 'NN:' prompt to logon to the BBS.

<b>Always Prompt for Password:
</b>	When set to 'Yes' this option will cause the user to ALWAYS be prompted
	for a password at logon, even if they have entered an incorrect (non-
	existant) name at the 'NN:' prompt.

<b>Disable Local Inactivity:
</b>	If you wish to disable the user inactivity warning and auto-logoff
	for local logons, set this option to 'Yes'.

<b>Disable Local Keyboard:
</b>	If this option is set to 'Yes', the local keyboard will be completely
	disabled when Synchronet is run. The only way to exit Synchronet would
	be to down the node from another process or reboot the machine.

<b>Local System Protection:
</b>	If you wish to require the system password for WFC commands and local
	sysop Alt-key combinations, set this option to 'Yes'.

<b>Beep Locally:
</b>	To disable the local speaker of this node for online beeps, set this
	option to 'No'.

<b>Allow 8-bit Remote Logons:
</b>	To allow E-7-1 terminals to use this node, set this option to 'No'.
	This will also eliminate the ability of 8-bit remote users to send
	IBM extended ASCII characters during the logon sequence.

<b>Reset Video Between Calls:
</b>	If this option is set to 'Yes', Synchronet will reset the current
	node console's video mode before each WFC cycle. This option should
	be set to 'No' for most configurations.</pre>
<h2><u>[3.3] - </u><a name="Node Advanced Options"><u>Node Advanced Options</u></a></h2>
<pre>When selecting this option, you will be brought to a sub-menu of options as
follows:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_node1_advanced.gif" width="652" height="331">

<b>Validation User:
</b>        This is the number of the user to whom validation feedback is sent.
        This value will usually be set to 1 (the sysop). If this value is set
        to 0, then new users will not be required to enter validation feedback.

<b>Screen Length:
</b>        This is the length of the system screen or video window. This should
        be set to &quot;Auto-Detect&quot; always, unless you have a specific reason
        to force Synchronet to think the screen length is a certain value.

<b>Screen Blanker:
</b>	When enabled, this will cause the screen for this node to blank out
	when waiting for a caller after the configured amount of intactive
	time.

<b>Semaphore Frequency:
</b>	This option specifies how often (in seconds) this node should perform
	semaphore checks (e.g. checks to see if an event should be run, the
	node should be downed, etc.).

<b>Statistics Frequency:
</b>	This options specifies how often (in secons) this node should check
	system statistics (calls per day, logons today, etc.).	Used when
	updating the WFC statistics display.

<b>Inactivity Warning:
</b>	This is the number of seconds of user inactivity before a warning
	(typically: &quot;Username, are you still there?&quot;) is displayed to the
	user.

<b>Inactivity Disconnection:
</b>	This is the number of seconds of user inactivity before the user
	is automatically disconnected.

<b>Cost Per Call:
</b>        This option should only be set to something nonzero for a billing
        node. A billing node is a node attached to special phone line that will
        automatically charge the caller a predetermined amount (usually area
        code 900 or prefix 976 numbers). Set this value to the amount that the
        caller will be billed after the initial 30 seconds. The user doesn't
        actually access the BBS through this phone number as 900/976 services
        charge the sysop by the minute an unrealistic amount. The user just
        enters his or her name/alias and password and their account is credited
        with the amount of credits per dollar specified in the System options
	multiplied by this field (Cost per call) and the user is hung up on.
        The user then calls the normal BBS nodes and has instant access to
        their purchased credits.

<b>Daily Event:
</b>        This is the command line to execute when the first caller after
        midnight logs off. If the program is located in the EXEC directory,
        this command line should start with the %! specifier.

<b>Control Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the control directory where all the shared
	configuration (.CNF) files for SBBS are stored. TEXT.DAT (the editable
        ASCII file that contains almost all of the color and text that SBBS
        displays) and a few miscellaneous binary data files are also stored
        in this directory. All nodes of the system must have the same control
        directory and this directory should not be located on a RAM disk.

<b>Text Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the text directory. This is where all menus,
        macros, SIF files, QWK files, system information, and other text
        files are stored. All data beneath this directory branch is READ ONLY
        as far as Synchronet is concerned, so changing this directory to a RAM
        drive would enhance performance and wouldn't risk data loss. If you do
        change this path, be sure to copy all the files and subdirectories of
        the original text directory there. If you do change this path to a RAM
        drive, you will need automate the copying of all of the files and
        subdirectories there upon system startup (possibly AUTOEXEC.BAT) with a
        sequence of commands like this:
<b>        md r:\text
        xcopy c:\sbbs\text\*.* r:\text /S
</b>
<b>Temporary Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the directory that this node will use for
        temporary file storage. This directory must point to somewhere unique
        and nonvolatile. All the files in this directory are deleted upon
        execution of the BBS, so do not store any files you want to keep in
        this directory. Each node must have its own temp directory. For
        increased performance on batch uploads, it is best if this directory
        is on the same disk drive as the majority of your file transfer
        directories.

<b>Swap Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the directory that this node will use for
	swapping to disk if &quot;Allow Swapping&quot; is set to 'Yes' and Swapping
	to EMS, XMS, and Extended memory is either disabled or not enough
	memory is available.</pre>

about any program because Synchronet will shrink to 16k before executing it.
Popular uses for these shrinking commands would be running a terminal program
or other large applications.</pre>
