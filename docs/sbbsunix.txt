Answers to Frequently Asked Questions
=====================================

Q. What flavors of Unix (and Unix-like operating systems) are supported?
A. Currently, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD are actively supported.
   Additionally, QNX and Solaris-x86 have been known to work in the past,
   but are not actively maintained.

Q. What distributions of Linux are supported?
A. Should work with any GNU/Linux-x86 distribution (e.g. RedHat, Mandrake, 
   Debian, Slackware, etc.).

Q. 64-bit?
A. Untested experimental support for 64-bit platforms is in CVS.  Use the
   directions available at
   http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/docs/64bit.txt
   in conjunction with this document for building and be prepared to deal with
   bugs.

Q. The installer (e.g. Linux-install from sbbsunix.tgz) segfaults, crashes,
   or fails to get the file size of sbbs_src.tgz.
A. This installer has known issues and is currently *unsupported*. Do not use
   it. This installer (known to us as "sbbsinst") will be revamped and
   re-released in the near future.

   In the mean-time, follow the steps given in this document to download,
   build, install, and run Synchronet for Unix.

Q. Linking error: undefined reference: '__ctype_b'
A: This is an issue linking the JavaScript library for Linux (libjs.a) on
   RedHat Linux 9 and Mandrake Linux 9 using glibc v2.3.2-11+.
 
   This issue has been resolved with the addition of libjs.so and libnspr4.so
   to the CVS repository (in the lib/mozilla directory). If you're having this
   problem, run "cvs update" in your lib and src/sbbs3 directories and
   rebuild.

   Another solution is to use the lib[moz]js.so file included with your Linux 
   distribution (if it is). See installation steps 1.E and 1.F for more
   details.

Q. Are non-x86 (Alpha, SPARC, 68k, PowerPC, etc) processors supported?
A. Not currently. Synchronet assumes a little-endian processor. It *may* work
   on other little-endian processors (e.g. Alpha), but hasn't been tested.
   Big-endian support is currently being developed for the v3.20 time-frame.

Q. Will Synchronet ever support big-endian and/or 64-bit processors?
A. Yes, that is the plan.

Q. Will Synchronet be ported to Mac OS X?
A. Definitely. See the 2 questions above.

Q. Where do I get Synchronet for Unix?
A. There are no binary distributions at this time, so you must get the source
   code from the Synchronet CVS repository (see the step-by-step instructions
   below for details) or by downloading the latest verified buildable source
   code tarball (tgz file) from ftp://vert.synchro.net/Synchronet.
   
Q. Will there be binary releases?
A. Maybe. Linux is a particularly difficult "platform" to deliver consistently
   compatible binaries for and unfortunately, it is the most popular Unix-like
   operating system we currently support.

Q. Can I mix Synchronet for Unix and Synchronet for Win32 or DOS or OS/2 nodes
   on the same BBS?
A. Yes. As long as all the nodes can access the same live data files (via LAN)
   you can have as many instances of Synchronet on as many different platforms
   as you wish.

Q. Does Synchronet for Unix support external DOS programs/doors?
A. Currently, only the FreeBSD build has doscmd support "built-in" (and this
   "support" requires emulators/doscmd to be installed):

   For FreeBSD, the path that is entered in the Start-up Directory is mapped
   as C:\ the current node directory is mapped as D:\ and the Synchronet 
   root directory is mapped as E:\.  When a DOS door is executed, a .doscmdrc
   is created in the node directory.  Copying this file and using it to run
   doscmd in X11 mode while running the setup programs is the simplest way
   to configure the doors.

   Other platforms can use DOSEMU or whatever is available for running DOS
   programs.

   There's a patch for "building-in" DOSEMU support with Synchronet for Linux:
   http://www.icequake.net/bbs/syncmods/index.html and
   (mirror) http://www.synchro.net/docs/linux-dosemu.html

   and a FAQ for using DOSEMU with Synchronet for Linux (without a patch):
   http://www.exeonline.com/bbs/howto-doors.txt

Q. What external programs/doors does Synchronet for Unix support?
A. External programs can either use standard I/O (e.g. bash, pico, Lord/X,
   PimpWars) or socket I/O (e.g. Synchronet XSDK doors).

Q. Does Synchronet for Unix require X-Windows?
A. No, Synchronet for Unix is currently a console-based application.
   However, it does have an X-based character mode console now.  The X11
   headers (Part of the X11-devel package or something similar) are required
   for this to work.

Q. Are there any plans to make an X-Windows front-end for Synchronet?
A. Possibly, but it would be optional.

Q. What are the recent developments in Synchronet?
A. There are changes (fixes, improvements, etc.) being made all the time.
   See http://cvs.synchro.net/commitlog.ssjs for a log of the most recently
   committed changes to the Synchronet CVS repository.

   New releases are always posted on the web-site (http://www.synchro.net),
   as well as announced in the Synchronet discussion groups
   (http://www.synchro.net/docs/support.html) and the Synchronet Announcements
   mailing list (subscribe at listserver@synchro.net).

Q. Can I use a different compiler to build Synchronet for *nix?
A. Yes, currently Synchronet has successfully been built with both GCC and ICC
   (The Intel C Compiler).  To specify an alternate compiler, add
   ``DONT_CLOBBER_CC=1 CC=icc CXX=icpc'' to the gmake command lines where
   icc is the C compiler name and icpc is the C++ compiler name.  If you get
   errors during the build (not warnings) please submit a bug report.  If you
   are using a commercial compiler other than ICC, we will probobly be unable
   to help you without a copy of the compiler.

Q. I'm using SELinux and nothing works.
A. Yes, you'll need to use chcon on each of the shared objects (.so files)
   chcon -t texrel_shlib_t /path/to/libwhatever.so
   Do this for each .so file that Synchronet creates.


Quick Install/Configure/Run Instructions
========================================

Note: Type each of the following commands at a Unix shell prompt. 
      Do not actually type the '#' character.

# mkdir /sbbs
# cd /sbbs
# wget http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/install/GNUmakefile
# gmake install SYMLINK=1
# export SBBSCTRL=/sbbs/ctrl
# /sbbs/exec/scfg
# /sbbs/exec/sbbs

If you have any problem with these commands, see the detailed step-by-step
instructions below:


Step-by-step Instructions
=========================

Note: These instructions assume you are already logged in as 'root'.

Note: Example command-lines are pre-fixed with '#', symbolizing the Unix shell
      prompt. You do not actually type the '#' character.

Note: The "make" command may be used in place of "gmake" on systems where
      the GNU Make utility is named "make" (e.g. Debian Linux).
      Type "make -v" to verify that "make" is indeed GNU Make.

Note: Any references to cvs.synchro.net can be replaced with
      cvs-mirror.synchro.net (the Synchronet CVS Mirror site run by Stephen
      Hurd) if you're having any problems with cvs.synchro.net.

Note: Skip to step 8 if you are updating an existing Synchronet installation.

1. Get the required installation and source code modules from CVS:

   A. Create the Synchronet BBS directory on your file system:
      # mkdir /sbbs

   B. Change to the Synchronet BBS directory:
      # cd /sbbs

   *> Optional Shortcut:
   *> At this point you can copy the file from this url: 
   *> http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/install/GNUmakefile
   *> into the Synchronet directory, run "gmake install SYMLINK=1"
   *> and then skip ahead to step 5.

   C. Get the required installation modules from the CVS repository:
      # export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.synchro.net:/cvsroot/sbbs 
      # cvs co run-sbbs3

   *> Recommended Shortcut for Linux systems:
   *> Download the last verified buildable source archive (for Linux)
   *> from ftp://vert.synchro.net/Synchronet/sbbs_src.tgz
   *> extract (with "tar -xzvf <filename>") in the Synchronet BBS Directory,
   *> and skip ahead to G.

   D. Get the required source code modules from the CVS repository:
      # cvs co src-sbbs3

   *> Reccomended Shortcut (existing JavaScript library):
   *> If your Unix distribution includes the file /usr/lib/libjs.so or
   *> /usr/lib/libmozjs.so, you can save a lot of time by using this
   *> library instead of the one supplied in the Synchronet CVS repository.
   *> If you have /usr/lib/libmozjs.so (instead of libjs.so), you can either:
   *> Create a symlink or copy of this file with the name /usr/lib/libjs.so
   *> or specify "JSLIB=mozjs" on the "gmake" command-line mentioned later.
   *> If libmozjs.so is not located in a standard library path such as
   *> /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib, you will also need to specify JSLIBDIR
   *> also on the gmake command-line such as "JSLIBDIR=/usr/lib/mozilla".
   *> If your system already has the JavaScript library, skip ahead to step 2.

   E. Get the required JavaScript library for your platform and build type:
      # cvs co lib/mozilla/js/linux.release
      or:
      # cvs co lib/mozilla/js/freebsd.release
      etc.
      Note: If you want to get the full source code to the Mozilla JavaScript
            library to build it yourself, the cvs repository is:
            :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot
            the module name is mozilla/js/src.

   F. Get the required NSPR library for your platform and build type:
      # cvs co lib/mozilla/nspr/linux.release
      or:
      # cvs co lib/mozilla/nspr/freebsd.release
      etc.
      Note: This step is not necessary if your system already has the file
            /usr/lib/libnspr4.so

   G. Create symbolic links to the Mozilla Libraries (JavaScript and NSPR) in 
      your /usr/lib directory:
      # ln -s /sbbs/lib/mozilla/*/linux.release/*.so /usr/lib

      or: Add these two directories to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
          variable.

   H. Get the required Cryptlib library for your platform and build type:
      # cvs co lib/cryptlib/linux.release
      or:
      # cvs co lib/cryptlib/freebsd.release
      etc.
      Note: This step is not necessary if your system already has the file
            /usr/lib/libcl.so

   I. Create symbolic links to the Cryptlib Library in your /usr/lib
      directory:
      # ln -s /sbbs/lib/cryptlib/linux.release/*.so /usr/lib

      or: Add these two directories to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
          variable.


2. Build Synchronet:

   Prerequisite: curses
      You must have either the curses or ncurses headers and library files
      installed on your system, or you must remove the USE_CURSES definition
      from the various GNUmakefiles in the src/sbbs3 tree. If you have the 
      files /usr/include/curses.h and /usr/lib/libcurses.a then you're ready
      to continue.

   A. Change to the Synchronet src/sbbs3 directory:
      # cd /sbbs/src/sbbs3

   B. Build the main executable (and utilities):
      # gmake RELEASE=1
      NOTES:
      1: If you're linking with /usr/lib/libmozjs.so, don't forget to add
         "JSLIB=mozjs" to the gmake command-line
      2: If X is not installed in /usr/X11R6, 
         use "gmake X_PATH=/path/to/X"
      3: To debug compile/link command-line problems, adding "VERBOSE=1"
         to the gmake command-line can be very helpful
      4: Warnings (if any) can be safely ignored
      5: The "current" code in the CVS repository is in a fairly constant
         state of change. And often, one or more projects will not build
         successfully on any given platform. This is a common occurance
         and is expected in a fluid development project such as this one.
         If you'd like a verifiably-buildable source code base, either
         download one of the source code archives (e.g. sbbs_src.tgz) or
         use a release label (tag) when checking out files from CVS.
      6: By default, this will build RELEASE binaries which will be smaller,
         faster, and consume less resources than a DEBUG build.  If you
         wish a DEBUG build, remove "RELEASE=1" from the gmake command-line.
         This will allow you to send us more useful error reports.

   C. Change to the src/sbbs3/scfg directory:
      # cd /sbbs/src/sbbs3/scfg

   D. Build the Synchronet configuration utility (SCFG):
      # gmake
      Note: If X is not installed in /usr/X11R6, 
            use "gmake X_PATH=/path/to/X"
      Note: Warnings (if any) can be safely ignored

   E. Congratulate yourself on a job well-done.


3. Prepare the "exec" directory:

   A. Change to the Synchronet exec directory:
      # cd /sbbs/exec

   B. Copy (or create symbolic links to) the following files:
      ../src/sbbs3/gcc.linux.exe.release/*
      ../src/sbbs3/scfg/gcc.linux.exe.release/scfg*
      (the paths will be different for other platforms or release builds)

      Example:
      # ln -s ../src/sbbs3/gcc.linux.exe.release/* /sbbs/exec
      # ln -s ../src/sbbs3/scfg/gcc.linux.exe.release/scfg* /sbbs/exec

   C. Copy (or create symbolic links to) the following shared libraries:
      ../src/sbbs3/gcc.linux.lib.release/*
      (the path will be different for other platforms or release builds)

      Example:
      # ln -s ../src/sbbs3/gcc.linux.lib.release/* /sbbs/exec

      Note: Another option is to create the symbolic links in your /usr/lib
            directory (note the trailing dot):
            # ln -s /sbbs/src/sbbs3/gcc.linux.lib.release/*.so /usr/lib

        OR: set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to your 
            gcc.<os>.lib.<build> directory:
            # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sbbs/src/sbbs3/gcc.linux.lib.release

   D. Build the required Baja {tm} modules (exec/*.bin):
      # gmake


4. Prepare the "xtrn" directory:

   A. Change to the xtrn/sbj directory:
      # cd /sbbs/xtrn/sbj

   B. Build Synchronet Blackjack:
      # gmake

   C. Change to the xtrn/sbl directory:
      # cd /sbbs/xtrn/sbl

   D. Build Synchronet BBS List:
      # gmake


5. Configure the BBS:

   A. Run the Synchronet Configuration Utility (SCFG)
      # /sbbs/exec/scfg /sbbs/ctrl
      (if you have problems with the curses interface, try running
       "scfg -id" instead)
      Tip: Set the SBBSCTRL environment variable and you won't have to specify
           the path to the "ctrl" directory on the command-line:
           # export SBBSCTRL=/sbbs/ctrl

   B. Change SCFG->Networks->QWK->Hubs->VERT:
      Pack Command Line               %@zip -jD %f %s
      Unpack Command Line             %@unzip -Coj %f %s -d %g
      Call-out Command Line           *qnet-ftp VERT dove.synchro.net YOURPASS
      (see docs/dove-net.txt for more details)

   C. You should also consider configuring important details about your BBS
      (like the name) in SCFG->System.


6. Running Synchronet:

   A. Set the SBBSCTRL environment variable to point to your "ctrl" directory:
      # export SBBSCTRL=/sbbs/ctrl

   B. Run the main executable (with default settings/options):
      # /sbbs/exec/sbbs

   C. To view available command-line options, run:
      # /sbbs/exec/sbbs help | more

   D. To view default settings (node and port numbers), run:
      # /sbbs/exec/sbbs defaults

   E. To change the default settings, edit the file /sbbs/ctrl/sbbs.ini

   F. For more details, see /sbbs/docs/sbbscon.txt


7. Debugging:

   You can either run Synchronet (sbbs) from the GNU debugger (gdb), or you
   can debug an sbbs crash "post mortem" provided you have a system-generated
   core file as a result of a crash. Often times, a core file is the best way
   to find the root cause of a crash, so if you can configure your system to
   create core files when sbbs crashes, that can be very helpful to the
   developers in finding and fixing any bugs and ultimately, improving the
   quality of the software.

   You can run "ulimit -c" to check if core file generation is enabled for the
   current user profile (0 = disabled, non-zero or "unlimited" = enabled). An 
   "unlimited" core file size is the preferred setting. If your system is
   configured for no core file generation, check for a call to "ulimit -c 0"
   in your /etc/profile (or similar startup file) and remove/edit the command.

   Linux Sysops: to help locate sbbs crash core files, the following
   lines in your /etc/sysctl.conf file can be helpful:

     # Controls whether core dumps will append the PID to the core filename.
     # Useful for debugging multi-threaded applications.
     kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
     kernel.core_pattern = /tmp/core.%e.%p

   This will place core files with the name "core.sbbs.####" in the /tmp dir
   instead of core.#### in the current directory (typically /sbbs/ctrl).

   A. Run the GNU debugger:
      # gdb /sbbs/exec/sbbs
      or:
      # gdb /sbbs/exec/sbbs /tmp/core.sbbs.####

   B. Run Synchronet (if no core file used):
      (gdb) run -nd

   C. After segfault or other crash (or when using a core), display back-trace:
      (gdb) bt

   D. If (and only if) the last line of the output looks like this:
      '#2  0x00000000 in ?? ()' (The number at the start will vary)
      display backtraces of all threads:
      (gdb) thread apply all bt

   E. Copy and paste in e-mail to rob[at]synchro[dot]net or post in one of the
      Synchronet discussion groups (http://www.synchro.net/docs/support.html).


8. Updating/synchronizing the source code with the CVS repository:

   A. Change to your Synchronet installation directory:
      # cd /sbbs

   B. Back-up your working exec directory:
      # cp -a exec exec.bak

   C. Get the latest changes from CVS:
      # export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.synchro.net:/cvsroot/sbbs 
      # cvs update docs exec xtrn src lib include

   D. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 (only).

   E. Shutdown and re-run sbbs.

   F. You're done. :-)
