1. Installing Synchronet:
   A. Follow the directions at http://wiki.synchro.net/install:nix

6. Running Synchronet:

   A. Set the SBBSCTRL environment variable to point to your "ctrl" directory:
      # export SBBSCTRL=/sbbs/ctrl

   B. Run the main executable (with default settings/options):
      # /sbbs/exec/sbbs

   C. To view available command-line options, run:
      # /sbbs/exec/sbbs help | more

   D. To view default settings (node and port numbers), run:
      # /sbbs/exec/sbbs defaults

   E. To change the default settings, edit the file /sbbs/ctrl/sbbs.ini

   F. For more details, see /sbbs/docs/sbbscon.txt


7. Debugging:

   You can either run Synchronet (sbbs) from the GNU debugger (gdb), or you
   can debug an sbbs crash "post mortem" provided you have a system-generated
   core file as a result of a crash. Often times, a core file is the best way
   to find the root cause of a crash, so if you can configure your system to
   create core files when sbbs crashes, that can be very helpful to the
   developers in finding and fixing any bugs and ultimately, improving the
   quality of the software.

   You can run "ulimit -c" to check if core file generation is enabled for the
   current user profile (0 = disabled, non-zero or "unlimited" = enabled). An 
   "unlimited" core file size is the preferred setting. If your system is
   configured for no core file generation, check for a call to "ulimit -c 0"
   in your /etc/profile (or similar startup file) and remove/edit the command.

   Linux Sysops: to help locate sbbs crash core files, the following
   lines in your /etc/sysctl.conf file can be helpful:

     # Controls whether core dumps will append the PID to the core filename.
     # Useful for debugging multi-threaded applications.
     kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
     kernel.core_pattern = /tmp/core.%e.%p

   This will place core files with the name "core.sbbs.####" in the /tmp dir
   instead of core.#### in the current directory (typically /sbbs/ctrl).

   A. Run the GNU debugger:
      # gdb /sbbs/exec/sbbs
      or:
      # gdb /sbbs/exec/sbbs /tmp/core.sbbs.####

   B. Run Synchronet (if no core file used):
      (gdb) run -nd

   C. After segfault or other crash (or when using a core), display back-trace:
      (gdb) bt

   D. If (and only if) the last line of the output looks like this:
      '#2  0x00000000 in ?? ()' (The number at the start will vary)
      display backtraces of all threads:
      (gdb) thread apply all bt

   E. Copy and paste in e-mail to rob[at]synchro[dot]net or post in one of the
      Synchronet discussion groups (http://www.synchro.net/docs/support.html).
