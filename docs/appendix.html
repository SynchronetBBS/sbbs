Command Line Options</a>

 <b><font color="#FF0000"><i>(v2 Only)</i></font></b>

</h2>
<pre>The Synchronet BBS program (SBBS.EXE or SBBS4OS2.EXE) can be run with optional
command line switches. The switches should be separated by a space. Slash (/)
and dash (-) are ignored, so &quot;SBBS B&quot; and &quot;SBBS /B&quot; are equivalent. Case is
ignored, so &quot;SBBS B&quot; and &quot;SBBS b&quot; are equivalent. To list the available options
from the DOS command line, you may type &quot;SBBS ?&quot;. Here is a list of available
switches:

<b>B</b>	Use BIOS for video instead of direct screen writes
	- Older multitasking software may require this switch
<b>M</b>	Modem debug output
	- This switch is helpful in solving problems with modem initialization
<b>Q</b>	Quit after one call
	- SBBS will exit back to DOS (phone off-hook) after one user
<b>X</b>	Quit after one call (on hook)
	- SBBS will exit back to DOS (phone on-hook) after one user
<b>C#</b>	Connection already established at # bps
	- If user already connected, pass current connect rate (DCE)
<b>E#</b>	External event in # minutes
	- If there is a non-Synchronet event coming up, pass minutes left
<b>F</b>	Force daily event
        - Used to force SBBS to execute its internal daily maintenance
<b>L</b>	Local logon only
	- If you want Synchronet to immediately go to the local logon prompt
<b>I</b>	Don't initialize modem
	- If you don't want Synchronet to initialize the modem
<b>D</b>	Force Synchronet to think DCD is high
	- Normally only used for NULL modem connections
<b>Zs</b>	Pass Caller-ID string on command line as 's'
	- Used in combination with 'C#' option, normally from front-end mailer
<b>O</b>	Execute all pending events and immediately exit
	- Used with front-end mailers
<b>R#</b>	Additional rioctl call
	- This switch is for the internal use of Synchronet only (DO NOT USE)
<b>V</b>	Version information
	- Displays the detailed version and revision information of SBBS

The Synchronet Configuration Utility (SCFG.EXE, SCFG32.EXE or SCFG4OS2.EXE)
requires at least one command line switch (hard-coded into the included
SBBS.BAT and SBBS.CMD files): the path to your Synchronet CTRL directory
(e.g. &quot;SCFG ..\CTRL&quot;). While no other command line options are normally needed,
the following command line options may be specified:

<b>/M</b>	Show free memory in upper right corner
	- Show available memory instead of current time (n/a in SCFG4OS2.EXE)
<b>/N</b>	Don't use EMS for overlay caching
	- Don't use Expanded Memory if detected (only in SCFG.EXE)
<b>/S</b>	Don't check directories
	- Don't create directories on the disk(s) if they don't exist
<b>/F</b>	Force save of config files
	- Used by the Synchronet INSTALL program
<b>/U</b>	Update all message base status headers
	- Forces the update of SMB headers to match current config
<b>/H</b>	Don't update message base status headers
	- Don't attempt to update SMB headers to match config (if changed)
<b>/T#</b>	Set supported time slice APIs to # 
	- 0=DV if detected(default), 1=Int28, 2=WinOS2, 4=NoDV (SCFG.EXE only)
<b>/B#</b>	Set automatic back-up level
	- Set number of back-up files (*.CN# files) to keep (default=3 max=10)</pre>
<h2><a name="Appendix_C">[18.3] - Appendix C: SBBS Environment Variables</a>

</h2>
<pre>During operation, Synchronet may write to several different environment
variables which can be utilized by other programs.  Some of these environment
variables are also used by the utility programs that are included with
Synchronet as well as third party programs written for Synchronet.  Following
is a list of environment variables and a brief explanation of them:

<b>SBBSCTRL</b>	This variable contains the path of the Synchronet CTRL
		directory.  This variable is NOT set by (and not required to
		run) SBBS, it must be set manually prior to running any
		programs which require it (the Synchronet NODE utility, for
		example).

<b>SBBSNODE</b>	This environment variable contains the path of the node
		directory of the current node. This variable is set by
		SBBS at the time it is executed. Some off-line utilities
		may require this environment variable be set during boot-up
		(AUTOEXEC.BAT), in which case it should point to your NODE1
		directory. SBBS.EXE will automatically reset this variable
		to point to the current node directory, for any online programs
		it may execute.

<b>SBBSNNUM</b>	This variable contains the NUMBER of the active node.  This
		variable is set by SBBS at the time it is executed.

<b>SBBSFILENAME</b>	This variable contains the NAME of the file currently being
		processed (up to 12 characters including '.', not padded with
		spaces).  This variable is set by Synchronet during 'Testable
		Filetype' events. The same information is written to the file
		SBBSFILE.NAM in the current node directory.

		NOTE: Upon returning from a 'Testable Filetype' event,
		      Synchronet will read in information contained in the
		      file SBBSFILE.NAM located in the current node directory
		      to determine if the filename has changed during the
		      testing process.

<b>SBBSFILEDESC</b>	This variable contains the ONE LINE DESCRIPTION of the file
		currently being processed (up to 58 characters).  This variable
		is set by Synchronet during 'Testable Filetype' events. The
		same information is written to the file SBBSFILE.DES in the
		current node directory.

		NOTE: Upon returning from a 'Testable Filetype' event,
		      Synchronet will read in information contained in the
		      file SBBSFILE.DES located in the current node directory
		      to determine if the file description has changed during
		      the testing process.

<b>DSZLOG</b>		This variable is automatically set by Synchronet to point to
		the file PROTOCOL.LOG in the current node directory. If a
		transfer protocol has been configured (in SCFG) to support
		DSZLOG, then this log file will be read in by Synchronet after
		the transfer is complete, to determine which files were
		successfully transferred and which files were not.</pre>

<pre>This status screen will be shown when the node is waiting for call if the
sysop (User #1) has EXPERT mode turned ON and this node has Status Screen While
WFC set to Yes in SCFG-&gt;Nodes-&gt;Node #-&gt;Toggle Options.

The first line has the current node number, the current month and day,
the amount of free disk space on the drive where the TEMP directory is located
(should be on the drive where the majority of uploads are received), the
user who was last on this node and with what type of connection.

The second line has the number of logons today for this node/system, the
total logons for history of the system, the time spent on today (in minutes) for
this node/system and total time spent on for history of the system.

The third line contains the number of E-mails sent today on the system/total
E-mails currently waiting on the system, total number of Posts made on the
system today/total posts in all sub-boards, number of feedbacks (E-mail to #1)
sent today/total E-mail waiting for User #1, number of New Users today/total
user slots on the system.

The fourth line has the amount of uploads to the system today (in Kilobytes),
number of files uploaded/total files in all directories, amount of downloads
today (in Kilobytes) and total files downloaded today.

If there are any active nodes or nodes with a critical error count, the status
of those nodes will be displayed below the above statistical information.</pre>
<h2><a name="Appendix_E">[18.5] - Appendix E: Node Status Display</a>

</h2>
<pre>Anywhere within Synchronet, you can list the users currently online with the
Ctrl-U command.

From the Main, Transfer, Multinode Chat, or Private Chat sections you can list
the current status of all the nodes with the '/L' command.

You can display the status of all nodes from the DOS command line (or batch
file) with the NODE utility.

If the WFC Status Screen is enabled, the status of all active nodes is
displayed.

<b>Node Status Line:</b>

The format of each node status line is as follows:
        
Node n: username action connection (flags) [sysflags]

Where:
	 n = node number
  username = user's name
    action = what the user is currently doing
connection = how the user is connected (bps rate if remote)
     flags = letters representing special modes of the node:
		A - Activity Alert Disabled:
		    User of this node will not be notified of
		    other users logging on or off other nodes.
		L - Node is locked for sysop use:
		    Node is temporarily reserved for sysop
		    use only.
		M - Message waiting for node:
		    An unreceived node-to-node message is
		    waiting for this node.
		P - Page disabled:
		    User of this node does not wish to allow
		    users of other nodes to page him for chat
		    or send him node-to-node messages.

  sysflags = modes that are sysop settable/viewable only:
		A - Anonymous:
		    User on this node is in anonymous mode.
		D - Down:
		    This node will be shutdown as soon as possible.
		E - Event:
		    This node will run it's daily event (if one
		    is specified) before waiting for another
		    call.
		I - Node will be interrupted:
		    Node connection will be terminated as soon
		    as possible.
		Q - Quiet:
		    User on this node is in quiet mode.
		R - Rerun:
		    This node will Rerun when user logs off.
		U - User data update:
		    This user's data has been modified by
		    another node and needs to be read from
		    disk.

If the node is not in use, the possible status are:
	Offline: Node is not currently running Synchronet
	Waiting for Call: Node is waiting for a call.
	Networking: Node is currently executing network functions.
	New User Logging On: A user is logging on as new.
	Waiting for all nodes to become inactive.
	Running external event.
	Waiting for node # to finish external event.</pre>
