<h2><a name="Appendix_C">[18.3] - Appendix C: SBBS Environment Variables</a>

</h2>
<pre>During operation, Synchronet may write to several different environment
variables which can be utilized by other programs.  Some of these environment
variables are also used by the utility programs that are included with
Synchronet as well as third party programs written for Synchronet.  Following
is a list of environment variables and a brief explanation of them:

<b>SBBSCTRL</b>	This variable contains the path of the Synchronet CTRL
		directory.  This variable is NOT set by (and not required to
		run) SBBS, it must be set manually prior to running any
		programs which require it (the Synchronet NODE utility, for
		example).

<b>SBBSNODE</b>	This environment variable contains the path of the node
		directory of the current node. This variable is set by
		SBBS at the time it is executed. Some off-line utilities
		may require this environment variable be set during boot-up
		(AUTOEXEC.BAT), in which case it should point to your NODE1
		directory. SBBS.EXE will automatically reset this variable
		to point to the current node directory, for any online programs
		it may execute.

<b>SBBSNNUM</b>	This variable contains the NUMBER of the active node.  This
		variable is set by SBBS at the time it is executed.

<b>SBBSFILENAME</b>	This variable contains the NAME of the file currently being
		processed (up to 12 characters including '.', not padded with
		spaces).  This variable is set by Synchronet during 'Testable
		Filetype' events. The same information is written to the file
		SBBSFILE.NAM in the current node directory.

		NOTE: Upon returning from a 'Testable Filetype' event,
		      Synchronet will read in information contained in the
		      file SBBSFILE.NAM located in the current node directory
		      to determine if the filename has changed during the
		      testing process.

<b>SBBSFILEDESC</b>	This variable contains the ONE LINE DESCRIPTION of the file
		currently being processed (up to 58 characters).  This variable
		is set by Synchronet during 'Testable Filetype' events. The
		same information is written to the file SBBSFILE.DES in the
		current node directory.

		NOTE: Upon returning from a 'Testable Filetype' event,
		      Synchronet will read in information contained in the
		      file SBBSFILE.DES located in the current node directory
		      to determine if the file description has changed during
		      the testing process.

<b>DSZLOG</b>		This variable is automatically set by Synchronet to point to
		the file PROTOCOL.LOG in the current node directory. If a
		transfer protocol has been configured (in SCFG) to support
		DSZLOG, then this log file will be read in by Synchronet after
		the transfer is complete, to determine which files were
		successfully transferred and which files were not.</pre>
<h2><a name="Appendix_E">[18.5] - Appendix E: Node Status Display</a>

</h2>
<pre>Anywhere within Synchronet's Telnet/RLogin interface, you can list the users 
currently online with the Ctrl-U command.

From the Main, Transfer, Multinode Chat, or Private Chat sections you can list
the current status of all the nodes with the '/L' command.

You can display the status of all nodes from the DOS command line (or batch
file) with the NODE utility.

<b>Node Status Line:</b>

The format of each node status line is as follows:
        
Node n: username action connection (flags) [sysflags]

Where:
	 n = node number
  username = user's name
    action = what the user is currently doing
connection = how the user is connected (bps rate if remote)
     flags = letters representing special modes of the node:
		A - Activity Alert Disabled:
		    User of this node will not be notified of
		    other users logging on or off other nodes.
		L - Node is locked for sysop use:
		    Node is temporarily reserved for sysop
		    use only.
		M - Message waiting for node:
		    An unreceived node-to-node message is
		    waiting for this node.
		P - Page disabled:
		    User of this node does not wish to allow
		    users of other nodes to page him for chat
		    or send him node-to-node messages.

  sysflags = modes that are sysop settable/viewable only:
		A - Anonymous:
		    User on this node is in anonymous mode.
		D - Down:
		    This node will be shutdown as soon as possible.
		E - Event:
		    This node will run it's daily event (if one
		    is specified) before waiting for another
		    call.
		I - Node will be interrupted:
		    Node connection will be terminated as soon
		    as possible.
		Q - Quiet:
		    User on this node is in quiet mode.
		R - Rerun:
		    This node will Rerun when user logs off.
		U - User data update:
		    This user's data has been modified by
		    another node and needs to be read from
		    disk.

If the node is not in use, the possible status are:
	Offline: Node is not currently running Synchronet
	Waiting for Call: Node is waiting for a call.
	Networking: Node is currently executing network functions.
	New User Logging On: A user is logging on as new.
	Waiting for all nodes to become inactive.
	Running external event.
	Waiting for node # to finish external event.</pre>
<h2><a name="Appendix_F">[18.6] - Appendix F: Log File Line Type
Specifiers</a>

</h2>
<pre>Each line in the daily caller log has a line type specifier (the first 2
characters). The specifiers and their descriptions follow:

!! Critical error
!* User auto-deleted
!% User expired
!= New day for statistics
!: Ran event
@  Modem connection established
@- Modem connection terminated
@! Modem error
@* Caller-ID information
@R RIP support detected
@W WIP support detected
++ Logon
+! Logon error
N  New user begins application
N+ New user finishes application
N! New user fails application
S+ Sysop enabling function
S- Sysop disabling function
S! Sysop security error
P+ Posted message
P- Removed message
P! Posting error
E  Read E-mail
E- Deleted E-mail
E+ Sent E-mail
EN Sent NetMail
E! E-mail error
C  Chat function
U+ Upload
U- Removed Upload
U! Attempted upload
D- Download
D! Attempted download
X- External program execution
T- Read text file
M+ Moved message
Q! QWK error
L! Log already exists (possible crash)
$+ Gained credits
$- Lost credits
*+ Gained minutes
*- Lost minutes

To view today's caller log, hit 'L' from the WFC screen or &quot;;LOG&quot; from the
main menu. Yesterday's caller log can be viewed by hitting 'Y' at the WFC
screen, or &quot;;YLOG&quot; from the main menu. The log files are stored in the
DATA\LOGS directory with a file for each day named in the format: MMDDYY.LOG.</pre>
