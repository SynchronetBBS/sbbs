CTerm terminal chariteristics:
------------------------------

End of line behaviour (wrapping):
The cursor is moved to the first character of the next line
as soon as a character is written to the last column of the
current line, not on the next character.  A tab will wrap
to the next line only if the current cursor position is the
last character on the line.

Control characters:

NUL:
	In doorway mode, indicates that the next character is
	a literal character.  The IBM CP437 character will
	be displayed.  This allows ESC and other control
	characters to be placed on the screen.

CR:
	Move cursor position to column 1 of the current line

LF:
	Move cursor position to same column of the next row.
	If current row is the last row, scrolls the screen up
	and fills the new row with the current attribute.

BS:
	Non-destructive backspace.  Moves cursor position to
	the previous column unless the current column is the
	first, in which case no operation is performed.

0x07:
	Beep

TAB:
	Moves to the next tab stop.  Does not overwrite any
	characters in between.  If the starting position is
	last column, advances to next line.  If starting
	position is the last column of the last line, performs
	a scroll, filling the new line at bottom with the
	current attribute and moves to the first character in
	the new line.

Control Codes:
--------------

Control codes are in the following format:
ESC {SPACE to '/'}{'0' (ZERO) to '~'}
	There may be multiple characters from the {SPACE to '/'} set
	before the terminating '0' to '~'

	Legal combinations which are not handled are silently dropped.

ESC D	(Disabled in current code)
	Scrolls window up one line filling the bottom line with the
	current attribute.
	SOURCE: BANSI.TXT

ESC M	(Disabled in current code)
	Scrolls window down one line filling the top line with the
	current attribute
	SOURCE: BANSI.TXT

Control Sequences:
------------------

Control sequences start with the Control Sequence Introducer which is
ESC [  CSI will be used to express this from now on.

Control sequences are in the following format:
CSI {'0' (ZERO) to '?'}{SPACE to '/'}{'@' to '~'}
	There may be multiple characters from the {'0' (ZERO) to '?'}
	and {SPACE to '/'} before the terminating {'@' to '~'} character.

	Legal combinations not handled are silently dropped.
	Illegal combinations are displayed.

Sequence Parameters:
	Parameters are expressed by the {'0' (ZERO) to '?'} character set.
	Sequences which use parameters use decimal parameters separated by
	a ';'.  The use of a ':' from the set is reserved.
	If the parameter string begins with '<', '=', '>', or '?' then
	this is a non-standard extension to the ANSI spec.

	Parameters will be shown as pX where X will be a decimal position
	number.  Surrounded by [] indicates the parameter is optional.

CSI = [p1] M
	NON-STANDARD EXTENSION.
	Defaults:  p1 = 0
	Sets the current state of ANSI music parsing.
	0 - Only CSI | will introduce an ANSI music string.

	2 - CSI |, CSI N, and CSI M will all intriduce and ANSI music string.

	Indicates that a font block is following.
	p1 indicates the font slot to place the loaded font into.  This must
	be higher than the last default defined font (See CSI sp D for list
	of predefined fonts)  p2 indicates font size according to the
	following table:
		0 - 8x16 font, 4096 bytes.

"ANSI" Music
============
This is the place where the BBS world completely fell on it's face in ANSI
useage.  A programmer with either TeleMate or QModem (the first two programs to
support "ANSI" music as far as I can tell) decided they needed a method of
playing music on a BBS conenction.  They decided to add an "unused" ANSI code
and go their merry way.  Since their product didn't implement CSI M (Delete
line) they assumed it was unused and blissfully broke the spec.  They defined
"ANSI" music as:
CSI M <music string> 0x0e

They used a subset of IBM BASICs PLAY statement functionality for ANSI music
strings which often start with "MF" or "MB", so the M after the CSI was often
considered as part of the music string.  You would see things such as:
CSI MFABCD 0x0e and the F would not be played as a note.  This just added
further confusion to the mess.

Later on, BananaCom realized the conflict between delete line and music, so they
added *another* broken code CSI N (Properly, erase in field... not implemented
in many BBS clients) which was to provide an "unbroken" method of playing music
strings.  They also used CSI Y to disambiguate delete line, CSI Y is supposed
to be a vertical tab (also not implemented in very many clients).  BananaCom
also introduced many more non-standard and standard-breaking control sequences
which are not supported by CTerm.

CTerm has further introduced a standard compliant ANSI music introducer CSI |

By default, CTerm allows both CSI N and CSI | to introduce a music string.
Allowed introducers are set by CSI = p1 M as defined above.

The details of ANSI music then are as follows:
The following characters are allowed in music strings:
"aAbBcCdDeEfFgGlLmMnNoOpPsStT0123456789.-+#<> "
If any character not in this list is present, the music string is ignored as
is the introducing code.

If the introducing code is CSI M the first char is examined, and if it is
a one of "BbFfLlSs" or if it is "N" or "n" and is not followed by a decimal
digit, then the music string is treated as though an M is located in front
of the first character.

The music string is then parsed with the following sequences supported:
Mx sets misc. music parameters where x is one of the following:
	F - Plays music in the foreground, waiting for music to complete
	    playing before more characters are processed.
	B - Play music in the background, allowing normal processing to
	    continue.
	N - "Normal" not legato, not stacatto
	L - Play notes legato
	S - Play notes stacatto
T### Sets the tempo of the music where ### is one or more decimal digits.
	If the decimal number is greater than 255, it is forced to 255.
	If it is less than 32, it is forced to 32.  The number signifies
	quarter notes per minute.
	The default tempo is 120.
O### Sets the octave of the music where ### is one or more decimal digits.
	If the decimal number is greater than 6, it is forced to 6.
	The default octave is 4.
N### Plays a single note by number.  Valid values are 0 - 71.  Invalid
	values are played as silence.  Note zero is C in octave 0.
	See following section for valid note modifiers.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or P Plays the named note or pause from the current
	octave.  An "Octave" is the rising sequence of the following notes:
	C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B
	This is contrary to normal music terminology.
	The special note "P" is a pause.
	Notes may be followed by one or more modifier characters which
	are applied in order.  If one overrides a previous one, the last
	is used.  The valid modifiers are:
	+ - Sharp.  The next highest semitone is played.
		Each sharp character will move up one semitone, so "C++"
		is equivilent to "D".
	# - Sharp.  The next highest semitone is played.
		Each sharp character will move up one semitone, so "C##"
		is equivilent to "D".
	- - Flat.  The next lowest semitone is played.
		Each flat character will move down one semitone, so "D--"
		is equivilent to "C".
	. - Duration is 1.5 times what it would otherwise be.  Dots are not
		cumulative, so "C.." is equivilent to "C."
	### - Notelength as a reciprical of the fraction of a whole note to
		play the note for.  For example, 4 would indicate a 1/4 note.
		The default note length is 4.
L### Set the notelength parameter for all following notes which do not have
	one specified (ie: override the quarter-note default)  Legal note lengths
	are 1-64 indicating the reciprical of the fraction (ie: 4 indicates a 1/4
	note).
<	Move the the next lowest octave.
	Octave cannot go above six or below zero.
>	Move to the next highest octave.
	Octave cannot go above six or below zero.

The lowest playable character is C in octave zero.  The frequencies for the
six C notes for the seven octaves in rising order are:
65.406, 130.810, 261.620, 523.250, 1046.500, 2093.000, 4186.000

Purists will note that the lower three octaves are not exactly one half of
the next higher octave in frequency.  This is due to lost resolution of
low frequences.  The notes *sound* correct to me.  If anyone can give me
an excellent reason to change them (and more correct integer values for all
notes) I am willing to do that assuming the notes still sound "right".

!!!PLEASE NOTE!!! If you are playing some ANSI Music then ask the user if they
heard it, ALWAYS follow it with an 0x0f 0x0e is the shift lock character which
*will* cause people with anything but an ANSI-BBS terminal (ie: *nix users using
the bundled telnet app) to have their screen messed up.  0x0f "undoes" the 0x0e.
