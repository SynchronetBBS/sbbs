CTerm terminal characteristics:
------------------------------

End of line behaviour (wrapping):
The cursor is moved to the first character of the next line
as soon as a character is written to the last column of the
current line, not on the next character.  A tab will wrap
to the next line only if the current cursor position is the
last character on the line.

Control characters:

NUL:
	In doorway mode, indicates that the next character is
	a literal character.  The IBM CP437 character will
	be displayed.  This allows ESC and other control
	characters to be placed on the screen.

CR:
	Move cursor position to column 1 of the current line

LF:
	Move cursor position to same column of the next row.
	If current row is the last row, scrolls the screen up
	and fills the new row with the current attribute.

BS:
	Non-destructive backspace.  Moves cursor position to
	the previous column unless the current column is the
	first, in which case no operation is performed.

0x07:
	Beep

TAB:
	Moves to the next tab stop.  Does not overwrite any
	characters in between.  If the starting position is
	last column, advances to next line.  If starting
	position is the last column of the last line, performs
	a scroll, filling the new line at bottom with the
	current attribute and moves to the first character in
	the new line.

Control Codes:
--------------

Control codes are in the following format:
ESC {SPACE to '/'}{'0' (ZERO) to '~'}
	There may be multiple characters from the {SPACE to '/'} set
	before the terminating '0' to '~'

	Legal combinations which are not handled are silently dropped.

ESC H	Set Tab
	Sets a tab stop at the current column

	SOURCE: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-048.pdf

ESC M	Reverse Line Feed
	Move up one line

	SOURCE: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-048.pdf

ESC _	Application Program String
	Begins a string consisting of the characters 0x08 - 0x0d and
	0x20-0x7e, terminated by a String Terminator (ST)
	The string is currently ignored.

ESC P	Device Control String
	Begins a string consisting of the characters 0x08 - 0x0d and
	0x20-0x7e, terminated by a String Terminator (ST)
	Supported OSC values:
		"CTerm:Font:p1:<b64>"
		Indicates the string is a loadable font. (CTerm 1.213)

		p1 is a font slot number, which must be higher than the last
		default defined font (See CSI sp D for list of predefined
		fonts). <b64> is the base64 encoded font data.  Font size is
		deduced from the size of the data.  This replaces the now
		deprecated CSI = Ps1 ; Ps2 {

		[ p1 [ ; p2 ] ] q
		Defaults:  p1 = 0  p2 = 0
		Indicates the string is a sixel sequence.

		p1 selects the vertical height of a single pixel.  This
		may be overridden by the raster attributes command, and
		is deprecated.  Supported values
		
			Value      Vertical Size
			-----      -------------
			0,1,5,6    2 pixels
			2          5 pixels
			3,4        3 pixels
			7,8,9      1 pixel

		p2 indicates if unset sixels should be set to the current
		background colour.  If p2 is 1, positions specified as 0
		remain at their current colour.

		Any additional parameters are ignored.

		The rest of the string is made up of sixel data characters and
		sixel control functions.  Sixel data characters are in the
		rage of '?' (0x3f) to '~' (0x7e).  Each sixel data character
		represents six vertical pixels.  The data is extracted by
		subtracting 0x3f from the ASCII value of the character.
		The least significant bit is the topmost pixel.

                Sixel Control Functions
                ! Pn X
			Graphics Repeat Introducer
			The character X is repeated Pn times.
		" p1 ; p2 [ ; p3 [ ; p4 ] ]
			Raster Attributes
			p1 indicates the vertical size in pixels of each
			sixel.  p2 indicates the horizontal size in pixels.
			p3 and p4 define the height and width (in sixels)
			respectively of a block to fill with the background
			colour.  This block may not extend past the current
			bottom of the screen.  If any pixel data characters
			proceed this command, it is ignored.
		# p1
			Colour Select
			Selects the current foreground colour from the
			sixel palette.
		# p1 ; p2 ; p3 ; p4 ; p5
			Palette map
			Defines sixel palette entry p1 and sets it as the
			current foreground colour.  p2 specifies the colour
			space to define the colour in, the only supported
			value is 2.  p3, p4, and p5 specify the red, green,
			and blue content as a percentage (0-100).
		$
			Graphics Carriage Return
			Returns the active position to the left border of
			the same sixel row.  Generally, one pass per colour
			is used.  In passes after the first one, sixels
			with a value of zero are not overwritten with the
			background colour.
		-
			Graphics New Line
			Moves the active position to the left border of the
			next sixel row.

		$ q pt
		Request Status String (DECRQSS)

		pt is the intermediate and/or final characters of a control
		function to query the status of.  The terminal will send a
		response in the format

		DCS p1 $ r pt ST

		p1 is 1 if the terminal supports querying the control
		function and 0 if it does not.

		pt is the characters in the control function except the CSI
		characters.

		Currently supported values of p1:

		m	Request SGR parameters
		r	Request top and bottom margins
		t	Request height in lines
		$|	Request width in columns
		*|	Request height in lines

ESC ^	Privacy Message
	Begins a string consisting of the characters 0x08 - 0x0d and
	0x20-0x7e, terminated by a String Terminator (ST)
	The string is currently ignored.

ESC ]	Operating System Command
	Begins a string consisting of the characters 0x08 - 0x0d and
	0x20-0x7e, terminated by a String Terminator (ST)
	Supported OSC values:
		4;(pX;pY)...
		Specifies one or more palette redefinitions.
		pX is the palette index, and pY is the colour definition
		Color format:
			rgb:R/G/B
			Where R, G, and B are a sequence of one to four
			hex digits representing the value of the
			red, green, and blue channels respectively.

		SOURCE: xterm

		104 [ ; Ps ... ]
		Resets palette entry to default.  If the entire string
		is "104", resets all colours.  Otherwise, only each index
		separated by a semicolon is reset.

Control Sequences:
------------------

Control sequences start with the Control Sequence Introducer which is
ESC [  CSI will be used to express this from now on.

Control sequences are in the following format:
CSI {'0' (ZERO) to '?'}{SPACE to '/'}{'@' to '~'}
	There may be multiple characters from the {'0' (ZERO) to '?'}
	and {SPACE to '/'} before the terminating {'@' to '~'} character.

	Legal combinations not handled are silently dropped.
	Illegal combinations are displayed.

Sequence Parameters:
	Parameters are expressed by the {'0' (ZERO) to '?'} character set.
	Sequences which use parameters use decimal parameters separated by
	a ';'.  The use of a ':' from the set is reserved.

	Blink indicates the blink bit.
	Bold indicates the bold bit.
	FG indicates the foreground colour.
	BG indicates the background colour.
	TF indicates that the Tru Colour foreground is changed.
	TB indicates that the Tru Colour background is changed.

	NOTE: For 38 and 48, two additional formats are supported, a palette
	selection and a direct colour selection.

	For palette selection, an additional two parameters are required
	after that value.  They are considered part of the 38/48, not separate
	values.  The first additional parameter must be a 5.  The second
	additional parameter specified the palette index to use.  To set the
	foreground to orange, and the background to a fairly dark grey, you
	would send:
	CSI 38 ; 5 ; 214 ; 48 ; 5 ; 238 m

	The default palette is the XTerm 256-colour palette.  See here:
	https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/

	For direct colour selection, an additional four parameters are required
	after that value.  They are considered part of the 38/48, not separate
	values.  The first additional parameter must be a 2.  The second,
	third, and fourth specify the R/G/B values respectively. CTerm handles
	this with an internal temporary palette, so scrollback may not have the
	correct colours.  The internal palette is large enough for all cells in
	a 132x60 screen to have unique foreground and background colours
	though, so the current screen should always be as expected.

"ANSI" Music
============
This is the place where the BBS world completely fell on it's face in ANSI
usage.  A programmer with either TeleMate or QModem (the first two programs to
support "ANSI" music as far as I can tell) decided they needed a method of
playing music on a BBS connection.  They decided to add an "unused" ANSI code
and go their merry way.  Since their product didn't implement CSI M (Delete
line) they assumed it was unused and blissfully broke the spec.  They defined
"ANSI" music as:
CSI M <music string> 0x0e

They used a subset of IBM BASICs PLAY statement functionality for ANSI music
strings which often start with "MF" or "MB", so the M after the CSI was often
considered as part of the music string.  You would see things such as:
CSI MFABCD 0x0e and the F would not be played as a note.  This just added
further confusion to the mess.

Later on, BananaCom realized the conflict between delete line and music, so
they added *another* broken code CSI N (Properly, erase in field... not
implemented in many BBS clients) which was to provide an "unbroken" method of
playing music strings.  They also used CSI Y to disambiguate delete line, CSI Y
is supposed to be a vertical tab (also not implemented in very many clients).
BananaCom also introduced many more non-standard and standard-breaking control
sequences which are not supported by CTerm.

CTerm has further introduced a standard compliant ANSI music introducer CSI |

By default, CTerm allows both CSI N and CSI | to introduce a music string.
Allowed introducers are set by CSI = p1 M as defined above.

The details of ANSI music then are as follows:
The following characters are allowed in music strings:
"aAbBcCdDeEfFgGlLmMnNoOpPsStT0123456789.-+#<> "
If any character not in this list is present, the music string is ignored as
is the introducing code.

If the introducing code is CSI M the first char is examined, and if it is
a one of "BbFfLlSs" or if it is "N" or "n" and is not followed by a decimal
digit, then the music string is treated as though an M is located in front
of the first character.

The music string is then parsed with the following sequences supported:
Mx sets misc. music parameters where x is one of the following:
	F - Plays music in the foreground, waiting for music to complete
	    playing before more characters are processed.
	B - Play music in the background, allowing normal processing to
	    continue.
	N - "Normal" not legato, not staccato
	L - Play notes legato
	S - Play notes staccato
T### Sets the tempo of the music where ### is one or more decimal digits.
	If the decimal number is greater than 255, it is forced to 255.
	If it is less than 32, it is forced to 32.  The number signifies
	quarter notes per minute.
	The default tempo is 120.
O### Sets the octave of the music where ### is one or more decimal digits.
	If the decimal number is greater than 6, it is forced to 6.
	The default octave is 4.
N### Plays a single note by number.  Valid values are 0 - 71.  Invalid
	values are played as silence.  Note zero is C in octave 0.
	See following section for valid note modifiers.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or P Plays the named note or pause from the current
	octave.  An "Octave" is the rising sequence of the following notes:
	C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B
	This is contrary to normal music terminology.
	The special note "P" is a pause.
	Notes may be followed by one or more modifier characters which
	are applied in order.  If one overrides a previous one, the last
	is used.  The valid modifiers are:
	+ - Sharp.  The next highest semitone is played.
		Each sharp character will move up one semitone, so "C++"
		is equivalent to "D".
	# - Sharp.  The next highest semitone is played.
		Each sharp character will move up one semitone, so "C##"
		is equivalent to "D".
	- - Flat.  The next lowest semitone is played.
		Each flat character will move down one semitone, so "D--"
		is equivalent to "C".
	. - Duration is 1.5 times what it would otherwise be.  Dots are not
		cumulative, so "C.." is equivalent to "C."
	### - Notelength as a reciprocal of the fraction of a whole note to
		play the note for.  For example, 4 would indicate a 1/4 note.
		The default note length is 4.
L### Set the notelength parameter for all following notes which do not have
	one specified (ie: override the quarter-note default)  Legal note
	lengths are 1-64 indicating the reciprocal of the fraction (ie: 4
	indicates a 1/4 note).
<	Move the next lowest octave.
	Octave cannot go above six or below zero.
>	Move to the next highest octave.
	Octave cannot go above six or below zero.

The lowest playable character is C in octave zero.  The frequencies for the
six C notes for the seven octaves in rising order are:
65.406, 130.810, 261.620, 523.250, 1046.500, 2093.000, 4186.000

Purists will note that the lower three octaves are not exactly one half of
the next higher octave in frequency.  This is due to lost resolution of
low frequencies.  The notes *sound* correct to me.  If anyone can give me
an excellent reason to change them (and more correct integer values for all
notes) I am willing to do that assuming the notes still sound "right".

!!!PLEASE NOTE!!! If you are playing some ANSI Music then ask the user if they
heard it, ALWAYS follow it with an 0x0f 0x0e is the shift lock character which
*will* cause people with anything but an ANSI-BBS terminal (ie: *nix users
using the bundled telnet app) to have their screen messed up.  0x0f "undoes"
the 0x0e.
