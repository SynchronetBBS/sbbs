Status of this document
―――――――――――――――――――――――

  This document is a TITH Technical Standard (TTS) — it specifies
  the current technical requirements and recommendations for TITH
  software developers, coordinators and sysops of the Fidonet network
  and other networks using FTN technology.

  This document is released to the public domain, and may be used,
  copied or modified for any purpose whatever.

Abstract
――――――――

  This document describes how assets are placing into a bundle for
  transfer to another system.

1. Introduction
―――――――――――――――

  One of the core capabilities needed for an FTN network is the
  ability to transfer data from one node to another.  This standard
  defines the format to be used for that transfer.


2. Encoding
―――――――――――

  Data to be transfered between two nodes is collected into a single
  bundle for the transfer.  The entire bundle is TLV encoded as
  defined in TTS-0002.

  The bundle as a whole is a SignedTLV value as descrived in TTS-0003.

  The first item MUST be a Destination as defined in TTS-0003.

  The second item MUST be a Timestamp as defined in TTS-0003.  This
  timestamp indicates the time when the bundling process started.  In
  cases where an additional item is added to an existing bundle, the
  Timestamp is not updated (though the Length will be).

  After this, a sequence of values continues until the end of the
  bundle.  Types from 32 to 63 are reserved for experimental
  extensions to this standard, and may be used by explicit agreement
  between the operators of two nodes.  If the use is useful to other
  operators, it is RECOMMENDED that it be added to this document with
  a new number, and the software using it modified to use the new
  value.  Basically, as soon as three node operators agree to use the
  same value, it should be added to this document and the experimental
  value abandoned.


3. Types
――――――――

  The following types may be included in a bundle.

  64. Reserved
  ――――――――――――
  This type is reserved for a message type that does not yet have a
  TTS number.

  65. File
  ――――――――
  A File value which begins with an optional Filename as defined in
  section 4, followed by an optional Timestamp as defined in TTS-0003,
  followed by a required Contents as defined in section 4.

  If a timestamp is present, it represents the time of last
  modification of the file.

  66. FileRequest
  ―――――――――――――――
  A Request value which contains a manditory Filename as defined in
  section 4, optionally followed by a Timestamp as defined in
  TTS-0003.  If a Timestamp is present, the request is conditional on
  the last modified time of Filename being newer than the Timestamp.

  Existing FidoNet requests types (Bark and WaZOO) have an optional
  password, but it is expected that having public key authentication
  should be both more secure and easier to administer, making password
  controlled file requests obsolete.

  The WaZOO request can also request files the same age or older than
  the timestamp.  The author can't come up with a reasonable use for
  this, so is not including that functionality initially.

  Finally, WaZOO requests allow wildcards, which means the requester
  does not know the name of the file they're requesting, or how many
  files they are requesting.  However, since the Filename value is
  unrestricted, it's not like I can stop you can allowing wildcards
  in there.  I think it's a terrible idea though, and the processors
  written as part of the TITH project won't support them.


4. Ancillary Types
――――――――――――――――――

  The following types are defined for use by types in section 3.

  96. Filename
  ――――――――――――
  The value is a UTF-8 string containing the name of the file.  No
  restrictions are placed on the value of this string, but the name
  MUST NOT contain additional path components.  Software SHOULD NOT
  use values that are not allowed by common operating systems.
  Commonly this means no control characters (U+00 to U+1F, and U+7F),
  and none of U+22 ('"'), U+2A ('*'), U+2F ('/'), U+3A (':'),
  U+3C ('<'), U+3D ('>'), U+3F ('?'), U+5C ('\'), or U+7C ('|').

  97. Contents
  ――――――――――――
  An arbitrary sequence of bytes with no restrictions on contents or
  length.
