1. Introduction
───────────────

  FidoNet is fundamentally a way for systems to exchange messages.
  There is quite a bit of infrastructure built up around this that can
  be hard to understand from existing documentation.  This document
  attempts to act as a primer for someone new to FidoNet or FidoNet
  Technology Networks (FTNs).


2. The Message
──────────────

  The basic unit of information on FidoNet is the Message.  A message
  has an origin node (the system it originally entered the network
  on), a destination node (the system it should be ultimately
  delivered to), a from user name (the user on the origin node that
  created the message), a to user name (the user on the destination
  node the message should be delivered to), a subject, and a
  timestamp.  The message may also have one or more flags set.  The
  standard set of flags are "Private", "Crash", "FileAttached",
  "ReturnReceiptReqeuest", "IsReturnReceipt", and "AuditRequest".
  Finally, a message on FidoNet can have a "cost" associated with it.

  If the optional flags, only the "FileAttached" flag is well defined
  and in common use.  Historically, when the FileAttached flag is set,
  the subject of the message is replaced with the name of the attached
  file, and the original subject (if any) is lost.

  Cost is effectively never used, and can be considered optional, with
  anything that needs it assuming the absence of a cost indicates a
  cost of zero.

  The Message has been used to implement other features offered by
  FidoNet, and these usually work by modifying the text of the message
  itself.  Because of this, Messages should not start with the string
  "AREA:" or have lines starting with U+0001 (called Start of Heading,
  Ctrl-A, or SOH).


3. File Requests
────────────────

  Many Nodes on FidoNet support a second basic unit of information,
  known as a File Request.  These are not carried in Messages, and
  allow any system to request a file or a wildcard file specification
  from a FidoNet Node.  Usually, "Update" requests are also supported,
  can be used to request a file if the Node has a copy that has been
  modified more recently than a time you specify in the request.

  File Requests are not routed, and the requesting system must connect
  directly to the system that has the file available.


4. File Transfers
─────────────────

  FidoNet systems generally transfer Messages and File Requests as
  files, usually with specific names or extensions (PKT files for
  messages and REQ files for File Requests).  Most software to do
  these transfers will allow a system to send arbitrary files to the
  remote system without an accompanying message or any kind of File
  Request.


5. A Node
─────────

  A node is a system that is part of FidoNet and can send messages to
  and receive messages from any other node on the network.  There are
  two general classes of nodes, "Administrative Nodes" and "Member
  Nodes".  Member Nodes are normal systems, which are expected to have
  users that may originate and receive messages.  Administrative Nodes
  are expected to forward messages between other nodes, and may or may
  not have users.


6. A Nodelist
─────────────

  A nodelist is simply a list of nodes, with information on how and
  when you can exchange messages and request files.  In general, a
  standard nodelist expresses a hierarchal system starting with an
  Administrative Node, so every Member Node has at least one
  Administrative Node "above" it in the hierarchy.  The hierarchy as
  it exists on FidoNet is Zone, Region, Net, and Hub.  Every Member
  Node is listed as being "under" one of these four types in the
  Nodelist, and each of those types are "under" one of the previous
  types.  Every Hub is part of a Net, every Net is part of a Region,
  etc.  Historically, Zones and Regions were geographical, and
  Nets and Hubs were groupings of convenience, often based on the
  costs of making phone calls between them.

  Regions and Nets occupy the same component of a FidoNet address,
  Regions have the Net numbers 10 to 99, and Nets have numbers of 100
  and greater.


7. A Minimal Member Node
────────────────────────

  The minimum requirements for a Member Node is to have an entry in
  a nodelist and be able to exchange Messages with the Administrative
  Node above it.  While many times, most things will work without
  being listed in a nodelist, various failures can occur when a node
  is not listed.


8. A Minimal Administrative Node
────────────────────────────────

  An Administrative Node must be able to accept and forward messages
  whose origin or destination is "under" it in the hierarchy.


9. A Message Path
─────────────────

  There are two general methods of delivering a message to the
  destination node, either "Direct" where the ultimate destination is
  directly contacted and the message delivered, or "Routed" where the
  message is delievered to a series of Administrative Nodes which then
  forward it.  A Routed message may be delivered Direct by any node it
  passes through, it is not required that a message follow the
  hierarchy all the way to the highest common Administrative Node.  In
  fact, since there is no level above a Zone, there may not be a
  common node above any specific pair of nodes.


10. Points
──────────

  Points are an extra layer of addressing below the Node.  It is
  completely up to the Node "above" the Point what the Point
  represents.  The node a Point is under is referred to as the "Boss
  Node" for that Point, and all messages to and from the Point should
  go through the Boss Node.  Points are not expected to deliver
  anything Direct, and there is a high likelyhood of nodes (even
  Administrative Nodes) refusing to accept message Direct from a
  Point.


11. Addresses
─────────────

  FidoNet has a four component hierarcheal address for every node
  These components are Zone, Net, Node, and Point.  Each component can
  technically have any value from -32,768 to 32,767 inclusive.
  However, there are restrictions on what should be considered a valid
  component for each level, and some special exceptions for Points.

  The Zone component should only have a value between 1 and 32,767.

  The Net component should only have a value between 1 and 32,767 or
  the special value of -1, which should only be used to apply for a
  node number.

  The Node component should only have a value between 1 and 32,767 or
  one of the the special values of 0, which should only be used for
  Administrative Nodes, or -1, which should only be used to apply for
  a node number.

  If the Point component is 0, the address is of the Boss Node.  A
  Point address may be expressed in the range of 0 to 65535 instead of
  the range -32,768 to 32,767.  When expressed in this manner, a value
  of 32,768 is considered identical to -32,768, a value of 32,769 is 
  considered identical to -32,767, etc.

  When the Point is zero, it is almost always left out of the address.

  When writing FidoNet addresses, the most common format is the Zone,
  followed by a colon, followed by the Net, followed by the Node.  If
  the point is not zero, a period is placed after the Node, then the
  Point is placed at the end.

  The Zone is sometimes left out of an address.  In this case it
  should be obvious from context.  For example, if you're on a system
  with a Node Address of 1:103/1 and are creating a message whose
  destination you specify as 218/700, the zone will be assumed to be
  one and the point will be assumed to be zero.

  Addresses are often refered to as a number-D address.  The number is
  generally the number of components shown in the address, but in the
  case where the Point is left off because it is zero, it may still be
  called a 4D address.

  1D Address: 1 — This is very rare and should not be assumed to be
                  valid in most contexts.  This would indicate Node 1
                  on the same Zone and Net.
  2D Address: 103/1 — Much of FidoNet was designed for 2D addresses,
                      and this format is commonly supported by
                      software.  It is good pratice to abvoid using it
                      though.
  3D Address: 1:103/1 — This fully specifies a Zone, Net, and Domain,
                        and is the most common form of address seen.
                        This may be called a 4D address because the
                        Point is zero.
  4D Address: 1:103/1.100 — A full 4D address.


12. Domains
───────────

  An additional layer of addressing above Zones has been implemented
  by some software.  This layer is called a "Domain" and it represents
  a completely separate network hierarchy.  When Domains are in use,
  it is generally called "5D Addressing".  The most common form for a
  5D address is to place an @ at the end of the address, followed by
  the domain, such as 1:103/1@fidonet.  Most software that implements
  5D Addressing limits the domain to eight alpha-numeric ASCII
  characters, and treats it as case-insensitive, where "fidonet" and
  "FidoNet" are the same domain.

  For TITH however, domains are generally case-sensitive, may contain
  almost any Unicode code-point (with some minor restrictions), and
  have no length limit.  TITH places domains at the beginning of the
  address followed by a number sign, ie: fidonet#1:103/1.


12. AKAs
────────

  It is common, especially for Administrative Nodes, to have the same
  system acting as multiple Nodes on the same Network.  All messages
  between these Nodes are routed "Direct".  One address is generally
  chosen as the main address, and the rest of the nodes are AKAs.


13. Echomail
────────────

  Echomail is a special use of FidoNet messages to implement a one-to-
  many messaging system.  Each Echomail has an "Area", and each Node
  has a list of other nodes that are connected to that area.  When
  a post is entered in a specific Area, one Message is generated for
  each connected node.  The Message will start with an "AREA:" line,
  and will usually have multiple other lines added before and after
  the post text, some starting with a U+0001 or Ctrl-A character and
  others just have a specific sequence of characters.

  While it is common to get all your Echomail areas from your
  Administrative Node, this is not required or guaranteed by FidoNet,
  and may result in your posts taking a long time to be widely
  available.  It is often preferrable to connect an area to a system
  that will directly deliver new posts in an area quickly.  When doing
  this however, it is important to not connect other nodes (or allow
  other nodes to connect themselves) in a way that could create a
  "loop".

14. File Distribution Networks
──────────────────────────────

  File Distribution Networks act much like Echomail, but using the
  File Transfer capabilities of FidoNet.  Each file is accompanied by
  a Tick file (with the TIC extension) that carries much of the same
  information as an Echomail message.
