Step-by-Step instructions for setting up FidoNet using SBBSecho and InterMail
=============================================================================

One of the most difficult tasks that the novice sysop will encounter is the
setting up of FidoNet.	These instructions will take you step by step through
the process of setting up FidoNet on your BBS.	Be warned that these steps are
very basic, just enough to get FidoNet up and running on your system, but it
may still be necessary for you to refer to the documentation which accompanies
the programs referred to in these steps.  For any advanced operations you will
definitely need to refer to the documentation of programs referred to in these
steps.	If you know of anyone who is already on FidoNet that is willing to help
you out, by all means ask them for their help!

NOTE that while it doesn't cost anything to have a node number (for sending
and receiving netmail) or to receive local conferences, there is usually a
nominal fee (called "cost recovery") to receive conferences from the FidoNet
backbone or files from the FidoNet filebone.

 1) First of all you will need to obtain a copy of FidoNet's Policy 4 document
    (the filename is usually POLICY4.ZIP or POLICY4.TXT), a recent nodelist
    (usually named NODELIST.???), AND a front-end mailer program.  All three of
    these can normally be downloaded from any local BBS which carries FidoNet
    (if not, an e-mail to the sysop of a FidoNet BBS can usually point you in
    the right direction).  There are several front-end mailers available such
    as FrontDoor, InterMail, D'Bridge, SEAdog, Dutchie, BinkleyTerm, and Portal
    of Power to name a few (the latter two are referred to as "FLO-Style"
    mailers and the others are referred to as "Attach-Style" mailers).  Most
    front-end mailers offer a limited evaluation version which you can try out
    before you decide to purchase the program.

 2) Read the Policy 4 document, it will give you information about FidoNet as
    well as some specifics on how to obtain a node number for your system.

 3) If you do not plan to run InterMail (or FrontDoor which is very similar)
    you must set up the front-end mailer you plan to use by following the
    directions which accompany the program and then skip to step number 9.
    The documentation will also tell you how to "compile" the nodelist file
    you've downloaded so that your front-end mailer can use it.  Use the
    temporary address specified in Policy 4 when specifying your node address
    in the front-end mailer.

Setting up InterMail v2.xx or FrontDoor v2.xx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 4) Install InterMail per IM.DOC (included with InterMail).

    a) If using FrontDoor, follow the FD.DOC file and substitute the letters FD
       where ever you see an IM in this section.

 5) Copy the MAILER.BAT included with SBBSecho and the EXEBBS.BAT from the
    Synchronet DOCS directory into the InterMail directory (C:\IM).

 6) Change into the InterMail directory, run IMSETUP, and perform the
    following:

    a) Under Global->Address->Main, enter your FidoNet address (or the
       temporary address specified in Policy 4 until such time as you have
       received your own address).

    b) Under Global->Filenames, verify that the paths are set similar to the
       following:

    c) Under Modem->Advanced Setup->Connect Strings set ALL "BBSexit" levels
       to 100.	(For FrontDoor under Mailer->Errorlevels set all baud rates to
       100, Received Mail to 50, and Create .BAT file to Yes).

    d) Under Manager->Events, make sure all your events are set to exit when
       mail is received (under Event Behavior). This allows for the immediate
       importation of new messages into the BBS.

    e) Under Manager->Events, add the following event:

    f) Under Mailer->Misc, set "Trigger exit upon receipt of netmail" and
       "Upon receipt of ANY file" to Yes. This will allow for the immediate
       importation of NetMail and any File Distribution Echoes you may carry.

    g) Under Modem->Hardware, set "Lower DTR when busy" to "No".

    h) Under Modem->Command strings, set the "Down" string to "ATM0H1|".

    i) Exit IMSETUP.

 7) Unarc the nodelist file (NODELIST.???) that you downloaded previously
    into your nodelist directory.

 8) Now run IMNC to compile the nodelist.

Settup up FidoNet in SCFG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 9) Run SCFG from one of your node directories, or hit 'C' from the waiting for
    caller screen.  Then select Networks->FidoNet EchoMail and NetMail.
    You'll then be brought to a menu that should be set up similar to this:

    a) For FrontDoor the NetMail Semaphore file should be set to
       C:\FD\FDRESCAN.NOW and the EchoMail Semaphore file should be set
       to C:\FD\FDEXIT.025.

    b) For FrontDoor version 2.11, the EchoMail Semaphore file should be
       set to C:\FD\FDXIT.025.

    c) For FrontDoor version 2.20 (commercial, multinode), the EchoMail
       Semaphore file should be set to C:\FD\FDXIT#.025, where # is the
       node number (0 based).

10) Set your address to your system's FidoNet address (or the temporary address
    specified in Policy 4 until such time as you have received your own
    address).  This is the address used for sending and receiving NetMail. It
    will also be used as the default address for message sub-boards.

11) Create an origin line for your system that most likely contains your BBS
    name and phone number.

12) Following is an overview of the remaining options available on this menu:

    a) System Addresses:
       This option will bring you to a sub-menu to allow you to configure
       different addresses (AKAs) for your system. Following is an example
       for a BBS configured for two fido type networks.

			 ศออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

    b) Default Outbound Address:
       When a user sends netmail, this is the 'send to' address that is used
       as a default (useful for FidoNet<->Internet gateways).

    c) NetMail Semaphore:
       This is the name of the trigger file which will cause your front-end
       mailer to exit and scan for outgoing netmail.

    d) EchoMail Semaphore:
       This is the name of the trigger file which will cause your front-end
       mailer to exit and scan for outgoing echomail.

    e) Inbound File Directory:
       This is the name of the directory where your front-end mailer stores
       incoming files.

    f) EchoMail Base Directory:
       This is the base directory for your echomail subdirectories

    g) NetMail Directory:
       This is the name of the directory where your front-end mailer looks for
       and places netmail.

    h) Allow Sending of NetMail:
       When set to 'Yes' users can send netmail from your system.

    i) Allow File Attachments:
       When set to 'Yes' users can send netmail file attachments from your
       system.

    j) Send NetMail Using Alias:
       When set to 'Yes' the user alias will be used (rather than their
       real name) on outgoing netmail.

    k) NetMail Defaults to Crash:
       If set to 'Yes' netmail sent from your system will default to crash
       status (send immediately and directly).

    l) NetMail Defaults to Direct:
       If set to 'Yes' netmail sent from your system will default to direct
       status (send directly).

    m) NetMail Defaults to Hold:
       If set to 'Yes', netmail sent from your system will default to hold
       status.

    n) Kill NetMail After Sent:
       Setting this to 'Yes' will delete outgoing netmail after it has been
       sent.

    o) Cost to Send NetMail:
       This is the cost (in credits) that a user will be charged when sending
       netmail.

13) Setup SBBSecho by running the ECHOCFG program and reading the documentation
    for information on the available options.

    a) Under Paths...->Outbound Directory be sure to enter the path where
       outgoing mail packets and bundles should be placed (ie: C:\IM\OUTBOUND).

    b) Select the appropriate Mailer Type.

    c) Enter your registration number (if you are a registered owner of the
       SBBSecho program).

14) Once you have done this you must now run the file MAILER.BAT (if using an
    Attach-Style mailer) to use Synchronet with your front-end mailer.
    MAILER.BAT must be run from your front-end mailer's directory (e.g. C:\IM).
    You will no longer run the file SBBS.BAT to start this node (if you run a
    multi-node system, you will still use SBBS.BAT to start those nodes which
    are not using a front-end mailer).

    a) If you are NOT using InterMail as your front-end mailer, be sure to
       modify your MAILER.BAT file to reflect the front-end mailer that you
       are using.

15) Follow the instructions given in the Policy 4 document to determine who
    you should send netmail to in order to obtain your own node number.

16) Now, from your front end mailer, send a netmail to this person following
    the instructions contained in the Policy 4 document.  Once you have done
    this and the netmail has been sent, you should patiently await a netmail
    reply containing your node number and the node number of your hub (where
    you will send/receive your echomail and netmail to/from).

17) Once you have received your node number, you'll want to replace the
    temporary node number you used in your front-end mailer as well as in
    SCFG->Networks->FidoNet Echomail and Netmail->System Addresses to it.

18) Send your hub a message with the Area Manager (for the backbone <echomail>)
    and Areafix (for the filebone <files>) passwords you wish to use on their
    systems.  You will need to remember these passwords as you will be using
    them to do remote maintenance (such as adding and removing conferences and
    file areas that you wish to receive).

19) Your hub should respond with Area Manager instructions and a list of areas
    available for you to connect to.  If not, contact your hub for more
    information.

20) Look through the list of areas available to you and determine which
    conferences you'd like to carry.  In SCFG->Message Areas create a
    message group(s) for the conferences you'd like to carry.  When setting
    up a sub-board for a conference, be sure to use the "Area Tag" name
    given in the area list as the sub-board Short Name.

    a) Under Network Options... for each sub-board toggle the FidoNet
       Echomail option toggled to YES.

    b) If the conference requires a different address, configure the address
       under Network Options...

    c) If you allow aliases on your system, under Toggle Options... set Use
       Real Names to YES.

    d) If you are unfamiliar with adding message groups and/or sub-boards,
       consult that section of the Synchronet System Operator's Manual.

    e) For a more complete list of conferences available on the FidoNet
       backbone you may wish to download the file FIDONET.NA from either your
       hub or a local FidoNet BBS.  This file contains a list of ALL
       conferences carried on the backbone.

21) Once you have set up all of the conferences you'd like to carry, you'll
    need to go to SCFG->Message Areas-><group>->Export Areas...->AREAS.BBS
    (SBBSecho) to create an AREAS.BBS file for SBBSecho to use.

22) Now following the Area Manager instructions, send a message to your hub's
    Area Manager and turn on all of the conferences you wish to carry.	Note
    that there are some administrative conferences for FidoNet that your
    users shouldn't be able to read or post on, and some that even you
    shouldn't post on, there is also usually a "test" conference which you may
    want to set up to post messages on and insure that echomail is being sent
    and received properly.

23) That's about all there is to it.  You are now set up on FidoNet and should
    be able to send and receive FidoNet echomail and netmail.
