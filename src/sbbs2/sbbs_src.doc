History
=======

The Synchronet BBS software project began in December of 1990 when I started
writing my very own BBS program from the ground up. While it is true that I ran
Wayne Bell's WWIV BBS software for a number of years and an illicit copy of the
WWIV source code was my first exposure to the C Programming Language, I didn't
steal, borrow, or otherwise copy the WWIV source code for use in Synchronet in
any way. I did refer to Wayne's code from time to time when implementing
WWIV-compatible features like WWIV color codes, but I didn't need (or want) to
copy his source. I do wish to take this moment, however, to extend my
appreciation to Wayne Bell for his contributions to the BBS and hacker
communities, and for personally inspiring me to write a better BBS! ;-)

In 1992, Synchronet became a commercial venture for me (under the company name
Digital Dynamics) and was my sole source of income for over three years. The
commercialization of the Internet, and in paticular, the Wolrd Wide Web, has
all but eliminated the commercial BBS software market and in 1996, I officially
announced the end of Digital Dynamics (in the "Digital Manifesto"). In February
of 1997, my own BBS, Vertrauen, was abruptly shut-down. This time for good.
From September of 1988 to February of 1997, Vertrauen (German for "Trust")
answered the phone at 714-529-9525 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It went from
a 1 line "pirate" BBS running WWIV on an 8mhz 8088 to a 7 node Synchronet
BBS running on two 66mhz 486s connected to a Novell NetWare 3.12 file server
with many gigabytes of disk space, 7 CD-ROMS, Planet Connect Fidonet feed, the
whole nine yards - pretty much everything except Internet access (never could
justify the monthly costs of a full-time connection).

Today, I personally have very little interest in BBSs (using or operating them)
and my programming interests have been focused elsewhere for quite some time
(Internet communication products). For this reason, I am releasing the
complete source code (in C) for Synchronet BBS software and all other Digital
Dynamics' utilites. Since I expect no futher income from Synchronet BBS
software and have no plans on enhancing or supporting the product in any way, I
thought the least I could do was to package up, document, and publicly release
the source code for others to continue enhancing as they wish.


Disclaimer
==========

The accompanying source code (and this documentation) are not intended for the
beginning, or possibly even intermediate, programmer. You must have a healthy
knowledge of DOS, MAKEFILES, and the C Programming Language for this source
code to be of any use to you. Of course, beginners are encouraged to learn
(hopefully with the help of a friend or two) from the included projects - just
don't get too irritated if things don't compile and link the first time.

It is my hope that a hand full of capable young hackers will take Synchronet
into new directions. Hopefully, retaining the original name (Synchronet) in
some form, although there is no way for me to enforce this. I assume that some
will make minor modifications and re-release compiled versions under their name
with no credit to my work or the history of Synchronet, but while that isn't
"cool", it isn't illegal either. I am releasing the rights to every piece of
code accompanying this document to the public domain. That means that anyone
and everyone can do with it whatever they like as far as I'm concerned.

I, Rob Swindell, author of Synchronet, owner of Digital Dynamics, hereby
relinquish the copyright of Synchronet BBS software and all Synchronet-related
Digital Dynamics' utilities to the public domain. I am offering no warranties
of any kind. Use at your own risk.


Required Tools				Version 		Project(s)
==============				------- 		----------

Borland C++ for DOS and Windows 	3.1			SBBS.EXE
								SBJ.EXE
								SBL.EXE
								SCB.EXE
								SMM.EXE
								UTI*.EXE
								ADDFILES.EXE
								DELFILES.EXE
								DUPEFIND.EXE
								FILELIST.EXE
								SMBACTIV.EXE

  Note: Newer versions of Borland C++ tended to create larger, more memory
	hungry executables, so I stayed with 3.1 for these 16-bit DOS versions
	(where available DOS memory was a never ending issue with sysops).
	Newer versions of Borland C++ will work (with slight changes to the
	appropriate MAKEFILEs) for the above projects. The last five projects
	listed above are built with MAKEFILE.BC (i.e. make -fmakefile.bc)
	instead of MAKEFILE (used for Watcom).

Borland C++ for DOS, Windows, and Win32 4.5			SCFG.EXE
								SCFG32.EXE
								BAJA.EXE
								BAJA32.EXE
								SBBS4W32.EXE
								INSTALL.EXE
								QWKNODES.EXE
								SBBSECHO.EXE
								SMB2SBL.EXE
								SBL2SMB.EXE
								SMB2SMM.EXE
								SMM2SMB.EXE
								NODE.COM
								SLOG.EXE
								DSTSEDIT.EXE
								ANS2MSG.EXE
                                                                MSG2ANS.EXE
								EXECSBBS.COM

  Note: SBBS4W32.EXE, the 32-bit Windows version of Synchronet, is incomplete.
	Again, newer versions of Borland C++ (4.51, 5.x, etc) will probably
	work fine with slight changes to the appropriate MAKEFILEs. SCFG32.EXE
	is a native Win32 app that also runs under DOS (using Borland's DOS
	extender) - I don't know why the gettext/puttext is messed up.
	You'll need EXE2BIN.EXE (included with MS-DOS) to create EXECSBBS.COM.


Borland C++ for OS/2			2.0			SBBS4OS2.EXE
								SCFG4OS2.EXE
								SBBSECHO.EXE
								ADDFILES.EXE
								BAJA4OS2.EXE
								DELFILES.EXE
								DUPEFIND.EXE
								FILELIST.EXE
								INSTALL.EXE
								NODE.EXE
								SLOG.EXE
								CHKSMB.EXE
								FIXSMB.EXE
								SMBUTIL.EXE
								SMBACTIV.EXE
								DSTSEDIT.EXE
								ANS2MSG.EXE
								MSG2ANS.EXE
								EXECSBBS.EXE
								
  Note: Watcom makefiles are available for many of these projects and have
	the advantage of being able to be built from any environment (DOS,
	Windows, or OS/2) and create executables that run under all those
	environments. Borland C++ for OS/2, on the otherhand, can only be
	used in an OS/2 environment and can only create OS/2 executables.
	While Borland's C++ compilers definitely compile faster, the resulting
	exectubles created by Watcom C++ are usually smaller and faster.
	Any of the projects that don't already have support for Borland C++
	for OS/2, can probably be easily modified to do so (this excludes
	XSDK apps). Most popular executables are already supported.


Watcom C++				10.0a			ADDFILES.EXE
								AUTONODE.EXE
								DELFILES.EXE
								DUPEFIND.EXE
								FILELIST.EXE
								SBBSECHO.EXE
								SMBUTIL.EXE
								SMBACTIV.EXE

  Note: All flavors (16-bit DOS, 32-bit DOS, 32-bit OS/2, and 32-bit Windows)
	Love the cross-platform capabilites of Watcom C++!
	The NT\*.EXE files are Win32 executables that run native under either
	Windows 95 or Windows NT.
	The DOSX\*.EXE and DOS4G\*.EXE files are extended DOS executables that
	need DOS4G.EXE or DOS4GW.EXE (included with Watcom C++) in the search
	path. (Sorry 'bout the inconsistency in the sub-directory names,
	there's no difference between DOSX and DOS4G except that I used to have
	some extended DOS Borland projects write to the DOSX directories).

	*** IMPORTANT ***
	1) It is important that you delete all the files from the DOS and OS2
	   destination sub-directories (use CLEANALL.BAT) if you've previously
	   built a project using Borland C++ and wish to re-build it using
	   Watcom. The .OBJ files are NOT compatible between Watcom and Borland
	   (without some special effort).
	2) You must copy \WATCOM\SRC\STARTUP\WILDARGV.C from the Watcom C++
	   installation directory (or CD-ROM) into the SBBS\SMB\SMBUTIL
	   directory before attempting a Watcom build on the SMBUTIL project.
	   It's a copyrighted file, so I couldn't include it.

	Watcom can be/could have been used for some of the Borland-only
	projects, but due to its slow compile speed, I only used it for the
	projects that needed the best extended DOS support (DOS4G blows away
	Borland's DOS extender) and cross-platform compile (it was a pain to
	boot OS/2 every time I needed to build an OS/2 executable with Borland
	C++ for OS/2). Plus, Watcom's text-mode screen-libraries were sorely
	lacking (hence no CFG.EXE projects are built with Watcom).

Tool Notes
==========

As noted aboved, Borland C++ v4.5 (or possibly newer versions) may be used for
SBBS.EXE (and other BC v3.1 projects), but you will have less available DOS
memory (the executable will consume more memory).

Borland C++ v4.5 can also be used for many of the Watcom compiled utilities.
If you find MAKEFILE.BC in any of the Watcom compiled project directories, you
can use this makefile to build a 16-bit DOS, 32-bit OS/2, and in some cases
32-bit DOS executable with Borland C++. Likewise, any *.WAT makefiles (and most
of the MAEKALL.BAT files) are intended for use with Watcom C++.


Project Notes
=============

Most projects are built via MAKEFILE and/or .BAT/.CMD file. If you find a
MAKEALL.BAT or MAKEALL.CMD (for OS/2) file in any of the project directories,
this batch file is used to compile and link versions for all supported
platforms (e.g. DOS-16, DOS-32, OS/2, Win32, etc).

If a MAKEFILE or *.MAK file doesn't exist in the project directory, there may
be a simple MAKE.BAT/MAKE.CMD to build the executable. The simplest projects
may not include any type of MAKEFILE, BAT, or CMD file, but just require a
basic CC command line to compile and link into an executable (only the most
independant and smallest projects fit into this category).

The MAKEALL.BAT file in the source ROOT directory is used to build ALL
Borland C++ DOS and Win32 projects.

The MAKEALL.CMD file in the source ROOT directory is used to build ALL
Borland C++ OS/2 projects.

The WMAKEALL.BAT file in the source ROOT directory is used to build ALL
Watcom C++ DOS, DOS4G, OS/2 and Win32 projects.

Sub-directories are usually used to house the output files (.OBJ, .EXE, .MAP,
etc) for each supported platform. Sub-directories with the name DOS are used
for 16-bit DOS output files; sub-directories of DOSX, DOS32, or DOS4G are used
for 32-bit extended DOS output files; sub-directories of OS2 contain 32-bit
OS/2 output files; subdirectories of NT or W32 contain 32-bit Windows
(Windows NT or Windows 95) output files. In the more simple projects (e.g.
BAJA*.EXE), no sub-directories are utilized.

The makefiles (MAKEFILE.*, *.MAK, *.BC, *.WAT) are setup for my environment.
You will most likely need to make changes to these makefiles for your
environment. For reference purposes, these are the path locations of the
various tools in my environment:

Path			Tool
----			----
N:\BC31 		Borland C++ for DOS and Windows v3.1
N:\BC45 		Borland C++ for DOS, Windows, and Win32 v4.5
C:\BCOS2		Borland C++ for OS/2 v2.0
N:\WATCOM		Watcom C++ v10.0a

My system PATH environment variable contains N:\BC45\BIN, N:\WATCOM\BINB,
and N:\WATCOM\BIN. So if you see references (without path) to BCC, then that
would indicate Borland C++ v4.5. MAKE and MAKER are Borland's MAKE utilities
(included with Borland C++ v4.5, the latter being the 16-bit real mode
version). WMAKE is the Watcom MAKE utility.

My N:\BCxx\BIN\TURBOC.CFG file contains:

-IN:\BCxx\INCLUDE
-LN:\BCxx\LIB

I've made an effort to eliminate the project drive letter (N:) from all
MAKEFILEs and BATch files, but some references may still remain. If you only
have one hard disk on your system (C:) or your projects are stored on the same
drive the compiler(s) is/are installed on, then simply eliminating any drive
letter specifications is suggested.

Efforts have been made to eliminate all compiler warnings, but in some cases
warnings may persist. Especially when using a different compiler or version
than I have used. Any warnings in the source code I'm releasing may be safely
ignored. If you or anyone else has modified the code, then warnings in the
modified files should be investigated at your discretion.

C Header File Notes
===================

SBBS\SBBS.H
-----------
This is the main shared header file for Synchronet and Synchronet related
utilities. This header file contains prototypes for most all functions
contained in SBBS.EXE. But, more importantly, it #includes SMBLIB.H (which
indirectly #includes SMBDEFS.H), ARS_DEFS.H (which indirectly #includes
GEN_DEFS.H), SCFGVARS.C (which indirectly #includes SBBSDEFS.H, which
indirectly #includes NODEDEFS.H), SCFGLIB.H, RIOLIB.H, RIODEFS.H, and if "SBBS"
is defined (only in the MAKEFILE for SBBS) VARS.C (which indirectly #includes
text.h). So, as you can see, SBBS.H pretty much covers it in the header file
department for Synchronet and its related utilities. The only header files
that SBBS.H doesn't directly or indirectly #include are QWK.H, POST.H, ETEXT.H,
CMDSHELL.H, and SPAWNO.H. You will find this header file is the most commonly
#included header file in SBBS modules and Sycnhronet related utilities. The
comments are quite antiquated and may be safely ignored (e.g. /* DATIO.H */).

SBBS\SBBSDEFS.H
---------------
This file contains most constants, macros, and type definitions used for
Synchronet and its utilities. Since it is indirectly #included with SBBS.H,
you won't find it specifically #included very often.

SBBS\SCFGLIB.H
--------------
Contains type defintions and function protoypes only used in the initialization
of Synchronet's configuration structures. Used by the SBBS and SCFG projects
and all utilities that read Synchronet's configuration (*.CNF) files.

SBBS\GEN_DEFS.H
---------------
A small header file that contains general application independant constant
defintions and macros. This header file is #included directly or indirectly
with nearly every project.

SBBS\ARS_DEFS.H
---------------
Synchronet's Access Requirement Strings function prototype and constants.
This function prototype and constants were broken out for use in the SBBS\BAJA
(shell/module compiler) project.

SBBS\CMDSHELL.H
---------------
Contains constants, typedefs, and function prototypes specific to Synchronet's
command shell/module interpreter. Also used in the SBBS\BAJA (shell/module
compiler) project.

SBBS\POST.H
-----------
Contains type defintions for post_t and shared function prototypes for
the SBBS and SBBSecho projects.

SBBS\QWK.H
----------
Contains constants, type definitions, and function prototypes only used in
the QWK related portions of the SBBS project.

SBBS\TEXT.H
-----------
Contains constant defintions (via enum) for every text item in Synchronet's
TEXT.DAT file. Since this header file is indirectly #included with SBBS.H
in the SBBS project, you won't find it specifically #included very often.

SBBS\ETEXT.H
------------
Contains extern variable declarations for the encrypted text strings in the
SBBS project. This file is automatically created (along with ETEXT.C) from
ETEXT.DAT by the GENETEXT.EXE utility. The encrypted text strings are left
over from the commercial version of SBBS.

SBBS\VARS.C
-----------
This is a dual-purpose file. If GLOBAL isn't defined, then it's a C source
file for all of Synchronet's global variables. SBBS.H automatically #defines
GLOBAL to extern and #includes this file to automatically declare all global
variables as extern. This eliminates the double-entry work of creating
separate definitions and declarations for global variables. This file is
only used in the SBBS project.

SBBS\RIO\RIOLIB.H
-----------------
This file contains function prototypes for the Remote I/O Library API. This API
is consistent between DOS, OS/2 and Win32 versions.

SBBS\RIO\RIODEFS.H
------------------
Contains constants required for using the Remote I/O Library.

SBBS\SMB\SMBLIB.H
-----------------
Contains constants and function prototypes for the Synchronet Message Base
Library.

SBBS\SMB\SMBDEFS.H
------------------
Contains constants and type definitions required for using the Synchronet
Message Base Library.

SBBS\SMB\CRC32.H
----------------
Standard 32-bit CRC table and macro. Also included in BAJA, SBBSecho, and
other projects.

SBBS\SCFG\SCFG.H
----------------
Contains constant defintions, macros, global variable declarations, and
function prototypes for modules in the SCFG project.

SBBS\ECHO\SBBSECHO.H
--------------------
Contains constants, type definitions, and function prototypes for the
SBBSecho project.

SBBS\UTI\UTI.H
--------------
Small header file containing global variable declarations, constants, macros,
and a function prototype for modules in the UTI driver project.

SBBS\SDK\XSDK.H
---------------
Main header file for Synchronet external programs using the External
program SDK (XSDK). This header file #includes XSDKVARS.C (global variable
declarations) which indirectly #includes XSDKDEFS.H (constants and type
defintions).

UIFC\UIFC.H
-----------
Contains constants, macros, type definitions, and function prototypes for
the local console User Interface library. Used by the SCFG, SCBCFG, SMMCFG
and ECHOCFG projects.

SPWANO\SPANWO.H
---------------
Ralf Brown's spawno function prototypes. Used for swaping SBBS.EXE (16-bit
DOS) out of memory.


C Source File Notes
===================

Overlays
--------
The SBBS project (SBBS.EXE/SBBS4OS2.EXE/SBBS4W32.EXE) contains the largest
number of C source files and has the longest history. For a few years, SBBS.EXE
was a small 16-bit DOS executable that executed completely in memory (no
overlays). With each additional group of features, the executable file
(SBBS.EXE) inevitably increased in size and memory consumption. At one point I
started compiling two separate versions of SBBS.EXE, one with some of the
modules overlaid (dynamically swapped to/from disk), and another without
overlays (faster, but consumed more memory). This was the time with I began to
split off less-commonly called functions into modules that were specifically
overlaid (and given a filename ending in OVL.C, e.g. MAIN.C contains
non-overlaid code, and MAIN_OVL.C contains overlaid code).

As the exectuable grew larger and my knowledge and experience with optimization
of overlaid modules grew, I stopped making the non-overlaid version
altogether. The performance difference had become negligible and the memory
consumption of the non-overlaid version was unwieldly. Anyway, the point of
this little story is to help explain why so many of the filenames end in OVL.
Eventually, I ended up overlaying most of the modules (not just the ones named
with OVL). But still, you'll find that the code in the modules with the OVL
names is of the less-frequently executed variety. Only the 16-bit versions of
SBBS.EXE and SCFG.EXE use overlaid modules. All other projects (and the 32-bit
versions of SBBS/SCFG) do not explicitly use overlays.

Hi/Mid/Low Level
----------------
The modules with filenames containing HI (e.g. XFER_HI.C) contain high-level
code (mostly user-interface type functions); modules with filenames containing
MID (e.g. CON_MID.C) contain mid-level code (larger functions that don't
contain direct user-interfaces;, and modules with filenames containing LO
(e.g. XFER_LO.C) contain low-level code (smaller functions called frequently
from mid or high level code).

Comments
--------
Please excuse the sparse comments; I never planned on giving the source code
out. The source code that was originally distributed freely (SMB library and
XSDK) is better commented.


C Source Content Notes
======================

First off, make sure you're using an editor with tab stops set to 4 spaces
for *.C and *.H files (QEdit works nicely), otherwise the source will be mostly
unreadable (don't try to print the files without first exanding all tabs to
4 space tabstops). All MAKEFILES and other text files use 8 space tab stops.

If you're an experienced C programmer, the first thing you'll notice when
examining any of the source code is my somewhat unique style. It's your basic
K&R style C with significantly compressed whitespace. Most notably, I don't
put closing curly braces (}) on their own line (except at the end of a
function). Instead, I use consitent indentation to indicate nested logic and
control flow. Also, I don't indent the base code of a function, but I do indent
automatic variables. And I don't put white space between any operators except
&& and ||. This style comes from the usefulness of getting as much code as
possible in an 80x25 window (and saving printer paper). You'll notice, I do use
blank lines to enhance readability, but there are no strict rules I follow in
the blank line department. If my style really bugs you and you just can't get
used to it, then run the source through a C beautifier or other such C
formatting utility (but don't cry if it doesn't compile after that).

Example (K&R style):

main()
{
    char line[MAXLINE];
    int found = 0;

    while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0)
	if (strindex(line, pattern) >= 0) {
	    printf("%s", line);
	    found++;
	}
    return found;
}

Example (my style):

main()
{
    char line[MAXLINE];
    int found=0;

while(getline(line,MAXLINE)>0)
    if(strindex(line,pattern)>=0) {
	printf("%s",line);
	found++; }
return(found);
}

If you find blocks of code contained in "#if 0" and "#endif" or "/***" and
"***/", you can safely ignore or even delete this code (the compiler is
ignoring it). For some reason, I found it necessary or preferable to remove or
replace the code in question but wished to leave the old code temporarily
intact in case I changed my mind... I'm not going to be changing me mind. :-)

I've deleted all sections of code refering to registration numbers, keys, etc.
If you find some code remaining that appears to require a registration number
or key of some sort, it probably can be safely ignored (unless you've found it
impeding the operation of the program) - but there shouldn't be any.


Last Minute Updates
===================

The UTI, FIXSMB, QWKNODES, and SBL2SMB/SMB2SBL projects were all converted from
SMBLIB 1.x to 2.x at the last minute. They all compile, but haven't been
tested. The differences between SMBLIB 1.x and 2.x are mainly in the calling
conventions, so these programs should run fine, but I suppose you never know
what could've happened.
