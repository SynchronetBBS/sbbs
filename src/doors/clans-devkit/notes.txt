Okay, here's the source for the devkit.  A couple of notes:

mcomp.c may or may not work. :-)  i think it should since the structs
didn't change much.  also, you'll notice that the structs.h and defines.h
are redefined here. they are EXACTLY the same as the ones in the regular
source code.  i was too lazy to put them in the proper directories, but
you can, easily.

See genall.bat for a batch file I used to generate all the data files and
then compiled them...

For more details on all of this, see clandev.txt.

About the data files:

strings.txt -- standard language file
eventmon.txt -- monsters for random events
monsters.txt -- all monsters you fight in the mines (standard fights)
spells.txt -- all spells available to players
items.txt -- all items
npcs.txt -- all non-player characters you meet on the street or in events
pray.evt -- all prayer events
eva.txt -- all mine events (note that this ends in .txt, but is just like all the .evt events)
quests.evt -- all quests
church.evt -- church events
secret.evt -- a neat little, secret event :-)
