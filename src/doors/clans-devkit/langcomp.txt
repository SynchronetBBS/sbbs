What's this one do?
-------------------
langcomp is used to compile language (strings.txt) files.  The strings.txt
file should be in the data directory of the source code you downloaded.

You run it like
---------------
This...

	langcomp <strings>

Just use "strings" and it'll look for the file called strings.txt and
generate a strings.xl language file.  That's it.  The Clans uses strings.xl
in the .pak file, so that's what you'll likely want.  Another example:
If you run "langcomp blah", it'll look for blah.txt and generate blah.xl.
I know, it's not consistent with the other utils, but who the hell cares.

64000b Limit
------------
Yeah, there's a 64000 byte limit on the compiled strings file mainly
because under the memory model I used, that was the largest size of
data I could use with malloc (approximately).  I doubt that limit
exists with other systems and compilers, though.
