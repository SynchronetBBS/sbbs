What's this now?
----------------
ecomp is used to generate event files.  See clandev.txt for info on
event files and creating them.

How to use it
-------------
For more information on how to run ecomp, see clandev.txt.  But if
you're too lazy to load up the file, here's how to run ecomp quickly:

       ecomp source-event.txt destination-event.e

It's standard procedure to name "compiled" events as .e files, but
it's just a standard.  You can name them whatever.  Additionally,
source event files /were/ called .evt for some reason, but I recommend
just naming them .txt for simplicity.
