  `6Atop the mountain is a small wooden hut, oddly misplaced for this era
  in history.  However, an old man with a long gray beard emerges from the
  hut, adjusts his spectacles, and smiles at you.  "Welcome to my mountain,"
  he greets you.  "Wouldn't happen to have a fresh fish on you would you?"
  he asks.  "I just love a good fish filet, but these prehistoric fish are
  way too tough to catch.  Or maybe you want to hear my story, eh?"  You
  decide not to attack him. :)
