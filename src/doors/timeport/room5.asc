  `6You are in a dark, square room with a window on the wall, and four
  colored buttons beside it.  Immediately you hear the voices of other
  people, quite a few other people, in fact.  "This is the Discussion
  Chamber," somebody says to you.  "They can't monitor us in here...
  too much feedback from the circuitry that controls those four buttons."
  You try to find faces in the darkness, but they are too vague.
