  `6You are standing in a huge building.  Dust is drifting through the air
  and settling on the empty floor.  The building reminds you of a warehouse,
  with small windows high on the walls.  Against one wall of the rectangular
  room is a line of upright capsules, each with an iced-over portal through
  which the faces of frozen people are visible.  At the other end, a blue
  and red machine (the time portal itself) sits, awaiting for activation...
  awaiting to release the power of Time Travel.
