  `6Outside the hanger, you find a world in waste.  The sky is a dull red,
  and the ground is cold and dry.  A chilling wind blows, and unearthly
  noises fill the air.  A few plants, though dead in appearance, dot the
  area that might have once been a highway.  You wonder what sort of
  disaster caused this kind of absolute damage to the world you remember.
  No war did this.  It was something else altogether, you decide.  The
  thought of it chills your soul.
