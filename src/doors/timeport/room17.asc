 `6You walk into the saloon and look the place over carefully.  You see
 several tables, and a bar where an old man is busy serving drinks to an
 already drunk bunch of fellows.  A stairway goes up the wall behind the
 bar, to a balcony where 2 doors are visible.  The bartender is busy
 cleaning the bar and serving the patrons.
