 `6You are standing in the town square of a little town called Brettville.
 People are walking around as they go about their daily activities.  You
 have to step out of the way several times as people on horses trot by.
 Of the several buildings you see, the Saloon seems to be the most popular.
 A shady looking character standing outside the saloon offers to provide
 his handywork services to you.  He tells you that he can "make things."
