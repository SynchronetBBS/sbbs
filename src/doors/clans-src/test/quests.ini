# Quest information for The Clans
#
# When adding a new quest, add on the lines containing info like the ones given
# do not modify the first 16 quests, they are internal to the system!
#
#
#
# format:
#
#       Name    -- name of quest as user sees it
#       File    -- Event file containing this quest.
#       Index   -- quest's "Event" name (what you see in the event file)
#                       ex:  Event Quest1
#                               .
#                               .
#                            End
#                       use "Quest1"
#       Known   -- use this if you want this quest to be visible without
#                  having to be "told" it by an NPC or whoever.
#                  Usually SET THIS unless you know what you're doing.

# all lines starting with # are commented
