Reset Help for The Clans

^Date Game Starts
|07 The Start Date Configuration allows you to reset the game earlier than
 actually starting.  This option is very useful for League Coordinators
 in Inter-BBS games to force all systems to start on the same date (using
 league-wide reset).  This option is also useful for Tournament games in
 which you want to allow players to sign up early.
^END

^Last Join Date
|07 The Join Date option allows the sysop (or LC) to determine the last
 date a player can join the game.  This is useful for restricting access
 to latercomers in the game for tournaments, etc.
^END

^Village Name
|07 This option is only used in a local game.  It allows you to define the
 name of the village in the game.
^END

^Elimination Mode
 |07Elimination mode play is different from regular play.

 ** Feature not yet implemented in the current version.

 |12**NOTE**  |07In InterBBS games, only the League Coordinator can use this
 option.  If any other BBS sets it, it will not have any affect on the game.
^END

^Clan Travel
|07 This toggles whether or not a clan can travel from one village to another
 in a league.  (InterBBS Only)
^END

^Lost Troops
|07 This sets how many days before lost troops (and other data) will be returned
 to this BBS.  (InterBBS Only)
^END

^Clan Empires
|07 If you do not want the players to build up clan empires, toggle it off
 with this option.
^END

^Mine Fights
|07 This option sets how many mine fights a clan gets each day.
^END

^Clan Combat
|07 This option sets how many clan vs clan fights a clan gets each day.
^END

^Max Permanent Members
|07 This setting will allow you to choose how many permanent members a clan
 can have.  If you wish each user to go solo, set this value to 1.  On the
 other hand, if you want them to have the most number of members (disabling
 the ability of NPCs) set this value to 6.
^END

^Days Of Protection
|07 This is the number of days a clan will be in protection for.  Protection
 is used to allow new users to enter the game and build up a bit before
 being attacked by experienced users already playing.
