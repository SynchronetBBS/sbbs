        - when village attacked and ruler ousted, reset all votes


Game Notes:
        * Keep in mind that since we have *_Inits for Game_, User_, and
          Village_, we can use CRCs now.  That is, after *_Read is called
          within *_Init, we can check its CRC value.  If the CRC value is
          wrong, called *_Destroy and then System_Error("CRC Value is WRONG!")
          This way, the data is not updated to file like it should be and so
          we don't have to worry about bypassing anything to prevent the
          data from being accidentally written to file with a correct CRC
          value.  The CRC value can be determined WITHIN *_Write.
