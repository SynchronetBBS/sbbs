 "How to use flags"


  NOTE:  Txx flags are ALWAYS cleared before EFs are run so we can assume
         they are zero and don't need to run a ClearFlag Txx on them.

Event FlagExample
  SetFlag T1

  # the following is executed only if T1 is set -- which it is
  {T1}Text "T1 was set!

  # the following line should NOT execute
  {!T1}Text "T1 was NOT set! -- NEVER EXECUTES

  SetFlag T3
  Jump NextPart
End

Result NextPart
  # as you can see, the flag values are not cleared when jumping from block to
  # block

  {T3}Text "T3 is set!

  ClearFlag T1
  {!T1}Text "T1 has been cleared.

  {!T1 & T3}Text "T3 was set but T1 was not.

  # The following three lines sometimes appear and sometimes don't
  {R50}Text "Random display 1
  {R50}Text "Random display 2
  {R50}Text "Random display 3

  # ^ = TRUE, % = FALSE
  {^}Text "This should ALWAYS be seen
  {%}Text "This should NEVER be seen

  Prompt "Choose an option (1,2,3):
  {%}Option 4 NextLine
  {^}Option 1 NextLine
