:whatsnew
What's new since v0.95b7
------------------------
- Many fixes, cleanups too numerous to mention.
- Now compiles on Win32 and FreeBSD

What's new in v0.95b7 07-06-1999
--------------------------------
- WOW!  Almost a whole year since last update! :)  Just one day short.
- one fix: NPC problem encountered in mines is gone (i.e. NPC file not found??)
* NOTE: exe file has not changed since last time and hence retains its
  v0.95b6 name...
- more to come...

What's new in v0.95b6
---------------------
- fixed bug:  users would travel just before a reset and their clans would
  return after the reset.
- returning troops should now be updated properly (how did this get through!?)
- lost troops now return properly
- Fixed problem with having packets routed incorrectly through certain BBSes
  if the league got larger than a certain number of boards.
- changed BBS and Alliance listing in empire attack to wide format
- lastjoindate should work again (it was left out mistakenly!)
- fixed bug which would sometimes show clans as living even if all members
  were dead
- user data updated more often -- right after battle.
* there is a new version of Clan Dev Kit.  it fixes the monster compilation
  bug.

What's new in v0.95b5
---------------------
* Clans is now freeware!  For those who have registered, the game will
  continue to display your registration information so users know you did
  pay for the game.
- fixed bug with BBSInfo part of WORLD.NDX file which would not display
  properly had people used BBSIds such as 1,5,9,etc. instead of a normal
  1,2,3,4,.. order
- set BBSId to default of 0 if in a local game
- whether a reset was received by a BBS is now properly saved
- added a pause for league info screen so if there are lots of boards in the
  league, you can see all of their stats
- game should now create a score file like versions did before v0.95


What's new in v0.95b4
---------------------
* This version may actually work on most people's systems!  I tried running
  it on another computer I had access to and was able to reproduce the
  bugs which caused the game to crash upon entry and also IBBS crashes, so
  keep your fingers crossed that this version works for you.
- changed IBBS structures slightly
- reduced max. number of BBSes in IBBS leagues to 50 from 100
- misc. internal changes to code (forgot them all, unfortunately)
- set stack to default size

What's new in v0.95b3
---------------------
- added system errors caused by reading/writing/encrypt/decrypting 0 byte data
- fixed MAJOR bug in routing of packets -- it would cause the game to screw
  with memory and of course cause other major problems such as not allowing
  packets to be routed at all
- added /Verbose command line to help with debugging.  If your game returns a
  "CheckMem Failed." error run it with the /Verbose command line and give
  me the screen output so I can track down the problem.
- increased the stack size (again -- forgot about this when I recoded)
- added CheckMem to EncryptRead/Write
- Added NoMSG option in WORLD.NDX files -- add it to a BBS's info and the game
  will not create .MSG file for that BBS when a packet is sent to it.  Ex:

        BBSId           1
        BBSName         Revolution Nine
        VillageName     The Village
        Address         6:1/1
        Host 2
        NoMSG



What's new in v0.95b2
---------------------
- fixed minor bug in multihit spells which would screw memory in battle
- fixed minor bug which would give new playesr access to The Quest for
  Justice right away.

What's new in v0.95
-------------------
* Please forward all mail to ussher@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca
  I am getting rid of my old freenet account (prisoner@...)
* This new version has quite a few changes to data so you MUST RESET after
  upgrading.  If you are in a league, get everyone to upgrade and then reset!
  Packets are handled differently as well.
- made a few corrections and updates to CLANS.DOC
- removed Event option from Mines Menu (was used for debugging if you must
  know)
- complete user list is sent every 4 days to ensure that if a user was deleted
  on his board, all boards are updated
- Recoded initialization and de-initialization functions.  They are now
  somewhat foolproof.  Compared with old-code which was highly unstructured
  and basically messy, the new code is a bit more object oriented (but it's
  still in C, not C++)  Not like anyone will notice. :)
- Fixed a really dumb bug where if the user set the FOSSIL driver on, the
  game would not load the dropfile properly
- game no longer requires loads of xp (bug) if users get to level 49
- Very basic data encryption implemented.
- /UglyStatus taken out (pretty useless)...
* The bug which caused first item to get corrupted has finally been fixed!
- fixed minor bug which would cause player who chooses "Fight To Death" option
  to NOT attack right away
- when choosing a spell or item, enemy list is shown by default
- reset removed from CLANS.EXE and put in its own executable
- IBBS will no longer process WORLD.NDX files it finds in the inbound directory
  They must now be named WORLD.id where id = the league's ID to be read in
  used in place of the current world.ndx file.
- local msg index is no longer updated for outgoing global posts which do not
  post to local message base (i.e. clans' message system)
- updated printing function so it doesn't redundantly update the colours (using
  ANSI codes) if the new colour used is the same as the old colour.  This
  makes it slightly faster than the old version.
- a player disbanding on one BBS can no longer create a new clan that day on
  ANY BBS in the league.  Before it only applied to the BBS he was logged into
  last...
- fixed login ANSI to read KURANZU and not KURANSU
- new packets are ALWAYS read in when logging into an IBBS game (no need to run
  CLANS /I even though that is still a command)
- took out CLANS /O command (useless)
- updated a bunch of old colours
- PCEDIT.EXE was NOT included with this package.  A new player editor still has
  to be done.
- reset program and /SendReset work WAYYYY better now.
- added following commands to event files:
        GetKey          - just like Option but doesn't echo input
        Lxx             - ACS: user is at level xx
        Kxx             - ACS: user is at level xx or higher
- added a quality rating to markets...  The quality of the weapons will improve
  slightly on some days...on these days, STOCK UP on weapons 'cause they'll
  have lower requirements and higher stats!
