The Clans v0.95b7:  Upgrading
-----------------------------

All this fixes is the clans.pak file (i.e. NPC not found error message is
no longer encountered in mines)

IMPORTANT:


If you are using a version BELOW v0.95b4:

* You must reset after upgrading.

* If you are in a league, get everybody to upgrade then have everybody reset
  and choose the Join a league option while you (the LC) reset the whole
  league.

* If you have any packets lying around from previous league games, delete them
  all before upgrading!  They're easy to spot, just look for files of the
  form CLxxxyyy.* in your inbound directory

If you are using v0.95b4 or higher and upgrading, no reset is required.
