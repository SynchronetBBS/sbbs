                           Tournament FreeCell! 

     Tournament FreeCell is a multinode, Inter-BBS game.  You play against
the deck, compete with others on your BBS and even compete with other BBSs 
if your sysop belongs to an Inter-BBS league.

RULES:

    FreeCell is a solitare card game that has proven to be very addictive.
The playing field is divided into 8 columns of cards, 4 Home Cells (bottom
right of your screen) and 4 Free Cells (top right of your screen).  The
object of the game is to move all of the cards from the columns to the four
Home Cells.  This sounds easy, but there are some rules to follow:

    - Any card can be moved into or out of a Free Cell, but only one card 
      may be in each of the four Free Cells at any one time.
    
    - To move a card from a Free Cell or column onto another card in a
      column, the card on top must be the opposite color and one smaller than
      the card on bottom.  For example, you can move a two of diamonds onto
      a three of clubs or a three of spades, but not onto any other cards.

    - You can move any card into an empty column.
    
    - An ace must be the first card into a Home Cell.  Any other card can
      be added into this home cell if it is the same suit (hearts, clubs,
      etc...) and one higher than the card that is there.  For example you
      first place an ace of hearts into a Home Cell, then you must place a
      two of hearts, and then a three of hearts, etc... in order into that
      Home Cell.

    - Once you place a card in the home cell, you can not remove it.

    - You win the game if you can get all of the cards from the columns 
      into the four Home Cells in order.  Tournamnet FreeCell will help you
      move cards to the Home Cells if they are no longer needed in the 
      playing field (no smaller cards of the opposite color are in play).

MOVING CARDS:

To move a card, you simply choose the letter of the column or cell it is in
and then choose the letter of the column or cell you want to move it to.

The keyboard is layed out as follows:

                                                        7 8   <- Choose a
    A S D F  <- Choose Free Cells                       4 5 6    Column
     Z X C V <- Choose Home Cells                       1 2 3
                    <       Space Bar       > <- Cancel Selection


If you are moving an entire column of cards, the program will help you out,
but the rules of movement still apply (it will tell you if you try to move
to many cards at once).

If a card is no longer needed and can be moved to the Home Cells this will
be done automatically.  A card is no longer needed if all of the cards of
the opposite color and lower numbers are already in the Home Cells.



QUITING:

You can quit a game at any time by pressing Q.  When you leave a game you are
given the option of S)aving or F)orfiting.  If you save the match, the next 
time you play FreeCell, you will resume your match.  You may also view these
instructions again while playing by pressing I.

SCORING:

    Since this is a tournament, we assume you have already paid your entry    
fee and are now competing for your share of the pot.  You will receive $1.00
for every card you place in a Home Cell.  If you manage to place all of the
cards into the Home Cell and win the game, you will also receive a $100
bonus (for a total of $152.00 for a winning game).

    BBS's are ranked in tournaments based on the AVERAGE score of all
players.  This makes the competition more fierce since even the smallest 
BBS's can win the tournaments.

NOTE:  If you notice that you're not seeing the card symbols for 'clubs' 
you may have Compuserve Quick B transfers enabled or another answerback to
Ctrl-E.  This should be disabled, if you know how.
