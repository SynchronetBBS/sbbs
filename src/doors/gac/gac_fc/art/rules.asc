                           Tournament FreeCell! 

     Tournament FreeCell is a multinode, Inter-BBS game.  You play against
the deck, compete with others on your BBS and even compete with other BBSs 
if your sysop belongs to an Inter-BBS league.

PLAYING:

    FreeCell is a solitare card game that has proven to be very addictive.
The playing field is divided into 8 columns of cards, 4 Home Cells (top
right of your screen) and 4 Free Cells (middle right of your screen).  The
object of the game is to move all of the cards from the columns to the four
Home Cells.  This sounds easy, but there are some rules to follow:

    - Any card can be moved into or out of a Free Cell, but only one card 
      may be in each of the four Free Cells at any one time.
    
    - To move a card from a Free Cell or column onto another card in a
      column, the card on top must be the opposite color and one smaller than
      the card on bottom.  For example, you can move a two of diamonds onto
      a three of clubs or a three of spades, but not onto any other cards.

    - You can move any card into an empty column.
    
    - An ace must be the first card into a Home Cell.  Any other card can
      be added into this home cell if it is the same suit (hearts, clubs,
      etc...) and one higher than the card that is there.  For example you
      first place an ace of hearts into a Home Cell, then you must place a
      two of hearts, and then a three of hearts, etc... in order into that
      Home Cell.

    - Once you place a card in the home cell, you can not remove it.

    - You win the game if you can get all of the cards from the columns 
      into the four Home Cells in order.  Tournamnet FreeCell will help you
      move cards to the Home Cells if they are no longer needed in the 
      playing field (no smaller cards of the opposite color are in play).

To move a card, you simply choose the letter of the column or cell it is in
and then choose the letter of the column or cell you want to move it to.

You can quit a game at any time by pressing Q.  When you leave a game you are
given the option of saving or forfiting.  If you save the match, the next 
time you play FreeCell, you will resume your match.

SCORING:

     Your score is determined by taking the percentage of games you have won
and multiplying that by your total games played.  So, if two players have the
same ratio of wins to losses, the winner is determined by who played the most
games.  BBS's are ranked in tournaments based on the AVERAGE score of all
players.  This makes the competition more fierce since even the smallest 
BBS's can win the tournaments.

NOTE:  If you notice that you're not seeing the card symbols for 'clubs' 
you may have Compuserve Quick B transfers enabled or another answerback to
Ctrl-E.  This should be disabled, or you should toggle card symbols OFF.
