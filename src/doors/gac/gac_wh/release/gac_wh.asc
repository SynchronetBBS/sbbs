                           Tournament WaHoo! 

     Tournament WaHoo is a multinode, Inter-BBS game.  You play against
three computer opponents, compete with others on your BBS and even compete 
with other BBSs if your sysop belongs to an Inter-BBS league.

    WaHoo was originally created around 1900 and has proven to be fun for
thousands of children and adults since then.  This is the first time WaHoo
has been available as a computer game.

PLAYING:

   Game play is simple.  You have four marbles that you must move from your
starting grid to the home grid (all the way around the board).  Each player 
gets one roll of the die per turn.  If you roll a six you get another turn.
   
   To get a marble out of the starting grid, you have to roll a six or a one.
If you roll anything else, you can not take a marble out of the starting 
grid.  If you have other marbles on the board, you can move one of them, but
if all of your marbles are in the starting grid you lose your turn.
   
   Once you have marbles out, you roll the die to determine how far you can 
move.  You can move any one of your marbles the full count on the die, but 
you can not jump over or land on your own marbles. Howver, if you land 
EXACTLY on one of your opponents marbles, that marble is returned to your
opponents starting grid.

   Once you make it around the board and are attempting to get into your
home grid, you will have to roll the exact number for the spaces remaining.  
For example if you have a marble one space away from the top of your home 
grid, you must roll a one.  You have four spaces in your home grid, one for
each of your four marbles.

   If at any time you can not move, play advances to the next player.


    You can quit a game at any time by pressing Q.  When you leave a game, 
you are given the option of saving it or forfiting the game.  If you save 
the game, the next time you play WaHoo, you will resume the same game.

SCORING:

    Scoring was not a part of the original WaHoo game, but since this is a
Tournament we have added the following scoring system:

	  200 points for a game win
           25 points each time you land on an opponent and send them to start
           10 points each time you get a piece into home
	 -200 points for forfeiting a game
	 -100 points for losing a game
	  -12 points each time an opponent lands on one of your pieces

Computer opponents do not receive scores, so only humans are ranked.
BBS's are ranked in tournaments based on the AVERAGE score of all
players.  This makes the competition more fierce since even the smallest 
BBS's can win the tournaments.
