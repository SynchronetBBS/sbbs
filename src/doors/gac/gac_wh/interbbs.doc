; INTERBBS.DOC - Sample Inter-BBS configuration file for GAC_CD games.
;
; In this file CD refers to the two letter code for the particular game.
; e.g.  if the executable name is GAC_FC.EXE then CD in this file is really
;       FC.  
;
; Be sure to look at the INTERBBS.DOC file for the game you are configuring.  
; All GAC_CD games use the same Inter-BBS routines and setup, but some may 
; have added options.
;
; Outbound files have the format "CDxxyyyy.zzz" where xx is the "to bbs"
; number (two digits), yyyy is a time stamp, and zzz is the league tag.
; e.g.  CD014558.GSC would be a file for BBS 1 in league GSC (4558 is the
;       time stamp)
;
; If you wish to use this file, rename it to INTERBBS.CFG and edit it.
;
; Any text following a semi-colon (;), and blank lines, are ignored.
;
; The league coordinator should gather the list of BBS's participating
; in this Tournament and the needed information ( e.g. node number, 
; location, name), choose a league ID (three letter), create/edit this file, 
; and send it (as a file attache) to each member.  The members should place
; it in their GAC_CD directory.  It is only necessary to manually send the 
; INTERBBS.CFG file to NEW members once, this is a security precaution to 
; make sure a system will not receive an INTERBBS.CFG from an invalid source.
;
; Anytime you add a league member, send that member the INTERBBS.CFG file 
; manually.  All the other systems will receive the file during maintenance.
;
; NEW! You may now automatically update all of the systems in your league
; by copying the new files to the OUT directory under your game directory
; (create it if it does not exist).  These files will be archived up 
; during outbound or maintenance along with any other outbound information.  
; For this to work, everyone must be using the GAC_CD.BAT file (it will 
; handle the read only attributes on the GAC_CD.EXE).
;
; You may even list the configuration options in this file, and the settings
; given here will override the local systems configuration.  This will insure
; that all of the BBS's in the league are setup identically.
;
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This section is to allow the League Coodinator to override all of the 
; local configuration options for this League.  This will insure that every
; BBS is setup identically.  If you do not want to override local options,
; comment these lines out with a semi-colon (;).
;
; Maximum Number of games/day
;
Max_Games 5
;
; The length of the Tournament (use a 0 to disable automatic resets)
;
Length 30
;
; If you want a simple routing system set UseWagonWheel to TRUE.  This will
; cause ALL BBSs to send information to the first system listed below (the 
; hub of the wheel).  This is called a wagon wheel since all members call
; the hub directly and resemble spokes on a wheel (use your imagination :)
Use_Wagon_Wheel FALSE
;
; If you do not want the game to check for duplicate players, set this to
; FALSE.
Check_For_Dupes TRUE

;
; List of other systems running the door, which the door should be linked to.
; For each system, the LinkWith, LinkNumber, LinkName, LinkLocation, and 
; LinkHost lines should be grouped together in order. 
; LinkWith     - the system's node address
; LinkNumber   - a unique Inter-BBS number for this system
; LinkName     - The name of the BBS
; LinkLocation - Where the BBS is located
; LinkHost     - The LinkNumbers for the systems this BBS should Hub for
;
; The LinkHost is very powerfull and allows the LC to control routing easily
; and effectively.  If a BBS is not going to be hubbing for any other BBSs,
; enter a 0 on the LinkHost line.  Otherwise, enter the numbers of the BBSs
; the system should hub for with a space between each (e.g. LinkHost 2 3 to
; route information to system numbers 2 and 3).  
;
; The routing system below is an example of a larger league.
;                                  1
;                                 / \
;                               4     3
;                            / | | \    \
;                          6   8 9  11    5
;
; BBS Numbers 6,8,9,11, and 5 would have:
; LinkHost 0
; BBS Number 1 would have:
; LinkHost 4 3
; BBS Number 4 would have:
; LinkHost 6 8 9 11
; and BBS Number 3 would have:
; LinkHost 5
;
; The following example has a routing structure like this:
;                              BBS 1
;                             /      \
;                         BBS 2      BBS 3
;                        /
;                     BBS 4
