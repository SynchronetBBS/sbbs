Using the Windows 95/NT 32 bit versions of this software should almost be 
the same as using the 16 bit versions.  Both versions support all of the
same command line parameters and use the same data files.  It is possible
to use both the 16bit and 32bit versions on different nodes of your system.

The standard documentation for this door will be the same for the 32bit and 
16bit versions.  Just replease the EXENAME with EXENAME32 (or batch file 
name).  However, there are a few things you MUST consider in order for the
32bit version to function properly.  Please read over the following sections
from the Open Doors Manual (by Brian Pirie) and the door should work well.

You will find the 32bit executable, ODOORS60.DLL and DTRON.EXE in the
archive WIN95NT.ZIP.

RUNNING WINDOWS 95/NT DOOR PROGRAMS
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               This section provides information specific to running door
               programs that are compiled with the Win32 version of OpenDoors.
               Please feel free to include this information in your program's
               manual.

               Since the Win32 version of OpenDoors resides in a DLL,
               ODOORS60.DLL, this file must be present on any system where your
               program will be run. Although Windows 95/NT will find this file
               if it is located in the same directory as your program's
               executable file, it is a good idea to install this DLL into the
               Windows system directory. This way, all programs using the Win32
               version of OpenDoors can share the same copy of the DLL,
               reducing the amount of disk space that is used.

               The required setup for a Windows 95/NT door will depend upon
               what BBS system it is being run under. If you the program is
               being run under a native Windows 95/NT BBS system, then ideally
               that BBS system will provide the ability to pass a live serial
               port handle to the door program, on the program's command line.
               Otherwise, you should run the door from a batch file, following
               the instructions provided below for running the program under a
               DOS-based BBS system. If the BBS system is able to pass a live
               Window communications handle on the door's command line, and you
               are using the OpenDoors standard command-line processing
               function (od_parse_cmd_line()), then you can just setup the BBS
               to run the program directly, using the command line:

                    YourProgramName.exe -handle xxxxxxxxxx

               where xxxxxxxxx is the serial port handle, in decimal format.
               You do not need to use the start command, nor the DTRON utility,
               and you do not have to change the COM<n>AutoAssign setting in
               the system.ini file.

               If you are running the Win32 door program under a DOS-based BBS
               system, or a Windows-based BBS system that is unable to pass a
               live serial port handle to the door program, then follow these
               steps:

               1.Add a line of the form "COM<n>AutoAssign=<x>" to the [386Enh]
                 section of your system.ini file. Here, <n> specifies the
                 serial port number that the BBS's modem is connected to, and
                 <x> will usually be 0. For example, if your modem is
                 connected to COM1, you would add a line such as
                 "COM1AutoAssign=0" (sans quotes). You will then have to re-
                 start your computer for this change to take effect. If you do
                 not do this, the Windows-based door program will not be able
                 to access the modem.

NOTE: If you need to use this series of steps, make your own batch file and
      call the door program (or batch file) from your batch file.  This way
      when new releases are sent out, your startup batch file will not be
      overwritten.  - Gregory

               2.Setup the BBS software to run the Windows-based door program
                 just as you would any other door program. You will probably
                 want to do this from a batch file. The command line that runs
                 the Windows program should be of the form:

                    start /w /m ProgramName.exe [any command line
                 parameters]

                 This will cause the Windows-based door program to start in
                 minimized mode, and cause the calling MS-DOS session to wait
                 until the Windows program exits before continuing. If you do
                 not wish the program to be started in minimized mode, remove
                 the /m from the command line. If you attempt to start the
                 door program by calling it directly, rather than using the
                 "start /w" command, the BBS software will immediately start
                 again, cause it to attempt to run simultaneously with the
                 door program.

               3.After running the start command, use DTRON.EXE or a similar
                 utility to re-enable DTR detection by the modem. Normally,
                 this command line will be of the form:

                    dtron /port x /bps y

                 Where x is the serial port number (0 for COM1, 1 for COM2,
                 etc.) and y is the locked bps rate. For example, if your
                 serial port is locked at 38400 bps and is connected to COM2,
                 you would use:

                    dtron /port 1 /bps 38400

                 For full information on the DTRON utility, simply type the
                 command line:

                    dtron /help

                 You may freely redistribute the DTRON utility that is
                 included in this package with your program.

               Additional information on the Win32 version of OpenDoors, and
               further explanation of some of these steps, is provided in
               chapter 6.


NOTE: Much of the following information is probably not needed to run this
      program.  However, I included it here for your reference. -Gregory

CHAPTER 6 - SPECIAL TOPICS

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE WIN32 VERSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               This section provides additional information on the Win32
               version of OpenDoors that isn't found elsewhere in this manual.
               If you are working with the Win32 version of OpenDoors, you
               should take the time to read this entire section. You should
               also read the sections in chapter 3 that describe how to compile
               and run Win32 programs that use OpenDoors.

               The Win32 version of OpenDoors has been designed to be as
               similar as possible to the DOS version of OpenDoors. This means
               that where possible, you can compile the same source code to
               produce both a DOS and a Windows program. However, if you are
               porting an existing DOS OpenDoors-based program to the Win32
               platform, there are some important things to keep in mind.

               The first thing to note is that under DOS, the program's
               execution begins in the main() function, whereas under Windows,
               it begins in the WinMain() function. To allow the same source
               file to build both DOS and Windows versions you can use
               conditional compilation. OpenDoor.h defines a constant of the
               form ODPLAT_xxx, indicating which version of OpenDoors is being
               used. Currently, this will be either ODPLAT_DOS, or
               ODPLAT_WIN32. However, if a OS/2 or Unix version of OpenDoors
               were created, they would use definitions such as ODPLAT_OS2, or
               ODPLAT_UNIX. Under the Win32 version, you should pass the
               nCmdShow parameter that is passed to WinMain into OpenDoors,
               through od_control.od_cmd_show. If you do not do this, the
               program will always start with the main window maximized,
               regardless of what the user has requested. Also, you will
               probably want to use the new od_parse_cmd_line() function in
               both DOS and Windows programs, to allow standard command-line
               options to be processed. The od_parse_cmd_line() function
               accepts command line information in the same format as it is
               passed to the main or WinMain() function. So, the general
               structure of an OpenDoors program that can be compiled under
               either DOS or Win32 now becomes:

               /* Add your own #includes here. */

               #include "opendoor.h"

               #ifdef ODPLAT_WIN32
               int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                  LPSTR lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
               #else
               int main(int argc, char *argv[])
               #endif
               {
                    /* Add local variables here. */

               #ifdef ODPLAT_WIN32
                  od_control.od_cmd_show = nCmdShow;

                  od_parse_cmd_line(lpszCmdLine);
               #else
                  od_parse_cmd_line(argc, argv);
               #endif

                    /* Add the rest of your program after this point. */
               }

               If you are porting existing OpenDoors programs over to the Win32
               version of OpenDoors, another issue that you will have to pay
               careful attention to is the fact that you are now working in the
               32-bit world. While 32-bit programming under a flat memory model
               has many advantages (no more 64K segments and related
               limitations, for example), you must be aware that the size of
               basic data types that you are used to using may have changed.
               For example, an int is now 32-bits wide instead of 16-bits wide.
               One of the places where this difference becomes very important
               is if you are performing file-I/O by directly dumping a
               structure to or from disk using functions such as fread() and
               fwrite(). In this case, you must declare your structures using
               types that are of the same size between the 16-bit and 32-bit
               worlds, in order for your file formats to be compatible between
               the DOS and Win32 versions of your program. For example, the
               EX_VOTE.C example program declares its structure using fixed-
               sized types that are always available to any program including
               "opendoor.h". These types are the following size, regardless of
               what platform you are compiling under:

               INT8     - 8-bit signed integer.
               INT16    - 16-bit signed integer.
               INT32    - 32-bit signed integer.
               BYTE     - 8-bit unsigned integer.
               WORD     - 16-bit unsigned integer.
               DWORD    - 32-bit unsigned integer.

               (NOTE: Obviously, the many details of 32-bit programming and
               Windows programming are beyond the scope of this document. For
               more information on the issues discussed here, you will probably
               wish to consult other sources of information on Win32
               programming.)

               As you are probably aware, the Win32 edition of OpenDoors makes
               extensive use of multithreading. The number of threads will
               depend on what mode OpenDoors is operating in. In some
               situations, all of the following threads may exist:

               - The client thread(s), which executes the code that you write
                 in your program, along with the OpenDoors API functions.
               - The local screen thread, which is responsible for drawing
                 your program's output on the screen, and receiving input from
                 the local keyboard.
               - The frame window thread, which handles the OpenDoors menus,
                 toolbar, status bar and sysop function keys.
               - The remote input thread, which receives input from the serial
                 port and adds it to OpenDoors common local/remote input
                 queue.
               - The carrier detection thread, which blocks and only executes
                 if the carrier detect signal goes low.
               - The time update thread, which updates the user's time
                 remaining online, and monitors user timeouts.

               Since most of these threads only execute when the operating
               system determines that there is actually something for them to
               do, the Win32 version of OpenDoors provides very high
               performance and responsiveness.

               You may also want to make use of multithreading directly within
               your program. If you do this, please note that while you may use
               threads to perform background processing, OpenDoors requires
               that you only call OpenDoors API functions from one thread.

               If you wish to customize the information that is displayed in
               the Help|About dialog box (including your program's name and
               copyright information), provide your own application icon, or
               add online help to the help menu, refer to the sections in the
               manual on the following od_control variables:

                    od_control.od_app_icon
                    od_control.od_help_callback
                    od_control.od_prog_name
                    od_control.od_prog_version
                    od_control.od_prog_copyright

               The section that describes how to run Windows based door
               programs under DOS-based BBS package indicates that
               COM<n>AutoAssign=0 should be set in the system.ini file. The
               explanation for this is as follows: The default value for this

               setting in Windows 95 is -1, which prevents any Windows-based
               program from accessing a serial port which has previously been
               used by a non-Windows-based program, until the window that
               program was running in is closed. By setting this value to 0,
               you are allowing the Windows-based door program to immediately
               use the modem, even while the MS-DOS session (VM) is still
               active. A value of <x> greater than 0 will allow Windows-based
               programs to access the serial port, only if the DOS-based
               program has not accessed the serial port for at least <x>
               seconds. For example, the default setting in Windows 3.1 was
               COM1AutoAssign=2, which allowed Windows-based programs to access
               the serial port if no DOS program had used it for at least 2
               seconds.

               The section that describes how to run Windows based door
               programs under DOS-based BBS package also indicates that the
               DTRON utility should be run after the start command returns. The
               reason for this is that when a Windows program exits and closes
               the serial port (by calling the CloseHandle() function), Windows
               95 lowers the DTR line on the serial port. Most modems are
               configured to respond to this by hanging up on the remote user.
               From talking to other people, it seems that this "feature" (or
               fundamental design flaw, depending on how you want to look at
               it) is unique to Windows 95, and won't effect OpenDoors when
               running under Windows NT. However, the majority of people will
               undoubtedly be using the Win32 version of OpenDoors under
               Windows 95. This is unfortunate, since the Win32 communications
               facilities are otherwise _very_ well designed. There is a rumor
               that Microsoft's next upgrade to Windows 95 will fix this
               problem. However, I must stress that this is only a rumor, and
               that I haven't received any confirmation about this from
               Microsoft.

               OpenDoors currently provides two solutions to this problem.

               First of all, OpenDoors has the ability to use an already open
               serial port handle, if that information is supplied to it.
               Hopefully, all Windows 95-based BBS software will provide the
               option of running a door program with the serial port still
               open, and allow you to pass that serial port handle on the door
               program's command line. OpenDoors allows the serial port handle
               to be passed on the command line, or set directly in the
               od_control structure, as is described later in this manual. On
               BBS systems where this form of hot sharing of the serial port is
               supported, the serial port can remain open at all times, and so
               the CloseHandle() problem is avoided.

               This means that the only situation where the CloseHandle()
               problem still has to be dealt with is when OpenDoors is running
               on a Windows 95 system and OpenDoors has to open the serial port
               itself (and so must close the serial port before exiting). This
               would be the case for most MS-DOS based BBS systems running

               under Windows 95, unless some intermediate layer is provided. By
               default, in this situation OpenDoors will disable DTR response
               by the modem just before it closes the serial port, by sending
               the AT&D0 command to the modem. The exact sequence of commands
               used by OpenDoors to do this is specified by the
               od_control.od_disable_dtr string. This DTR response disabling
               may be turned off by setting the DIS_DTR_DISABLE
               od_control.od_disable flag. Since many programs (OpenDoors
               included) assume that they can hangup the modem by lowering the
               DTR signal, a small utility will usually be run after the door,
               which first raises the DTR signal again, and then re-enables DTR
               response by the modem. Such a utility is included in this
               package, named DTRON.EXE. I wrote the DTRON utility so that you
               can freely redistributed it with your programs.

               So, to summarize, the DTR disabling by OpenDoors and subsequent
               reenabling by DTRON is only required for the Win32 version of
               OpenDoors running under Windows 95 when the modem is configured
               to hangup if the DTR signal is lowered, and the BBS software
               does not have the ability to pass a live serial port handle to a
               door program. Setting COM<n>AutoAssign in system.ini is only
               required for the Win32 version of OpenDoors when it is being
               called from an MS-DOS session that has previously accessed the
               serial port.

               Note that the Win32 version of OpenDoors requires Windows 95 or
               Windows NT. It will not run under Windows 3.x, even with Win32s.
               This is because OpenDoors makes use of the Windows 95/NT
               multitasking and multithreading services that are not available
               under Win32s.
