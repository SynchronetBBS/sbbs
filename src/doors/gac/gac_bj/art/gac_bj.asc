                           Tournament Blackjack! 

     Tournament Blackjack is a multinode, Inter-BBS game.  You play against
the house, compete with others on your BBS (in realtime if they are 
on-line) and even compete with other BBSs if your sysop belongs to an 
Inter-BBS league.

     Your winnings are kept track of in the house bank, and you receive a 
BONUS each day in case you went bust the previous day.  Scores are based 
solely on your bank balance, so your goal is to be the player with the most 
money at the end of the tournament.  BBS's are ranked in tournaments based 
on the AVERAGE wealth of its players.  This makes the competition more fierce 
since even the smallest BBS's can win the tournaments.

     When playing against others on-line, you play from the same card shoe,
and can chat with them during the hand.  To chat simply press any key while
waiting for your turn and then enter your message.  Or you can press '/?' 
to access the command help menu.

     House pays double on a natural blackjack or three sevens, 1.5 to 1 on 
regular blackjack, even money on other winning hands and ties (pushes)
break even. You can double down if you have enough cash or split pairs!

NOTE:  If you notice that you're not seeing the card symbols for 'clubs' 
you may have Compuserve Quick B transfers enabled or another answerback to
Ctrl-E.  This should be disabled, or you should toggle card symbols OFF.
