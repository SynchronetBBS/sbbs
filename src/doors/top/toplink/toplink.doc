                                [ Description ]

TOPLink is a teleconference linking program.  Specifically, it links TOP (The
Online Pub) teleconferences to almost any other teleconference program such as
another copy of TOP, a Major BBS teleconference, or even IRC on the Internet!

                                [ Gamma Notice ]

This is a gamma version of TOPLink, release in conjunction with the gamma
version of TOP.  It is fully functional but not complete.  Please report all
bugs to the author immediately!  See the end of this file for information on
how to contact the author.

The final release of TOPLink will contain the following enhancements:

    - File locking for more stable and secure interaction with TOP.

    - Support for TOP's Crash Protection.

    - Support for TOP v2.00 (final) when it is released.

                                [ Requirements ]

TOPLink requires:  128K of memory.
                   The Online Pub Teleconference (TOP) v2.00g1 or higher.
                   FOSSIL Communications Driver loaded.
                   SHARE.EXE loaded (or an operating system with built-in SHARE
                     support, such as OS/2).

NOTE:  At this time, there is no OS/2 or Win95 version of TOPLink.  This DOS
       version of TOPLink should work seamlessly with TOP for OS/2 or TOP for
       Win95.

                                  [ Licence ]

*** WARNING: Do not PKLITE, LZEXE or do any similar thing to TOPLink.  Doing so
             will corrupt the program!  TOPLink writes its configuration
             directly to the TOPLINK.EXE file.

It is recommended you put these files in a seperate directory from TOP.

                            [ Configuring TOPLink ]

Run TOPLink with a /CONFIG parameter to access the configuration manual.

Command line> TOPLINK /CONFIG

You will be able to configure these options by using the up/down cursor keys to
move to the option you wish to change.  Then hit ENTER to change that option.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your BBS Name
  - This is the name of your BBS system.

ANSI Stripping
  - If this is set to ON, TOPLink will remove all ANSI coming from the BBS you
    have linked to.

PubColour Code Sending
  - If this is set to ON, TOPLink will send PubColour codes to the BBS you have
    linked to.  This can be set ON if you are connect to another TOP
    teleconference, otherwise it should be OFF.

Show BBS Name
  - When turned ON, the name of the BBS is displayed in front of the text
    received from that BBS.  TOPLink usually looks better with this setting
    turn OFF, but can be confusing to the users especially if TOPLink is
    connected to another TOP teleconference.

Sending Delay
  - Some teleconference programs cannot received data at the rate TOPLink sends
    it.  If this is true of the teleconference TOPLink is linked to make sure
    this setting is set to a suitablely long delay.  For TOP systems a delay of
    7ms works well.

Checking Delay
  - In order to reduce the stress on a multi-tasking or network system TOPLink
    can be set to delay for a certain number of seconds between checking
    incoming text from the linked BBS, and incoming text from local useres.  If
    this setting is set to 0, TOPLink will continuously be checking for
    incoming messages.

Direct Text
  - This can be used to turn off access to direct text.  Direct text is text
    from the user that is sent exactly as the user writes it.  No braces "[]"
    or any other text is added to it.

BBS Commands
  - TOPLink has commands which the linked BBS can send.  If you do not want
    them to be able to, turn this option to OFF.

Give Time Slices
  - When there is no incoming text from the linked BBS and no incoming text
    from the local users, TOPLink will give up time slices to the operating
    system.  This can help overall system performance on a multitasked PC.

Channel Number
  - This is the channel number that you want TOPLink to "inhabit".  It can
    range from 0 to 2147483647.  TOPLink is currently _NOT_ able to use
    channels right up to 3999999999 (as TOP supports), nor is it able to use
    Personal Channels or Conferences.  Setting this to 0 means that TOP will
    reside in EVERY channel simultaneously.

Minimum Security
  - TOPLink can appear invisible to users who don't have a certain security
    level.  This allows you to prevent "twit" users or unverified users from
    using or seeing the link.  All text sent by TOPLink will be ignored by
    users who don't have this security level, and all text sent by these users
    will be ignored by TOPLink.  This can be set from 0 to 65535.

MaxNodes Setting
  - This should be set exactly the same as the MaxNodes setting in your TOP.CFG
    file.

Crash Prot. Delay
  - This setting is not used in this version of TOPLink, but it will be used in
    the next (release) version.  For now, you MUST set the CrashProtDelay
    setting in TOP.CFG to 0!  TOPLink does not currently support TOP's crash
    protection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you have set the options to your preference press the <ESC> key. You will
be prompted as to if you want to save the settings.  Type "Y" if you want them
saved, "N" if you don't.

                             [ DONTSHOW.TXT File ]

Any message you don't want displayed from the other BBS should be added to this
file.  Usually message sent text is ignored since it adds a lot of extra
clutter.  Up to 50 lines can be placed in the DONTSHOW.TXT file with an ASCII
text editor.

Sample DONTSHOW.TXT file:
-Sent-
-- Message Sent --
-- Sent --

The file must be placed in the SAME directory TOPLink is in.

                              [ Linking to a BBS ]

First of all, make sure TOP HAS BEEN RUN PREVIOUSLY OR IS RUNNING.  TOPLink
will not initialize/create the *.TCH files.

Then call the BBS you want to link to using any terminal program that allows
you to shell to DOS.  Enter the BBS's teleconference and shell to DOS.  Then
run TOPLink with these parameters:
=========================================================================
TOPLink <com port> <BBS Name> <TOP work path> <node>

<comport>    Is the com port you are going to use.
             COM1 = 1, COM2 = 2, etc.
<BBS Name>   Is the name of the BBS (Only one word!) you are linking to.
<work path>  Is the path to TOP's work directory.
<node>       Is the node TOPLink should use.

Example:
Command Line> TOPLINK 2 Nucleus d:\top\workdir
=========================================================================

                          [ While TOPLink is Running ]

TOPLink will load and a Pub entry message should appear to all the TOP users.
The screen should look something like this once TOPLink has started:

*****************************************************************************

The window displays what TOPLink sends or receives from the com port and what
it does to it shown by the right hand section of the window.

These are the codes and what they mean:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sent - Text that is sent to the other BBS.
Rcvd - Text received from the other BBS but not broadcasted to the local TOP
       users.
Brod - Text received from the other BBS and is broadcasted to the local TOP
       users.
DTxt - Direct text sent from a local user.  No braces "[]" or any other text
       is added to it.
-Who - Sending response from a (TOP:WHO) command issued by the linked BBS.
-Ver - Sending response from a (TOP:VER) command issued by the linked BBS.

Availible commands in the TOPLink session:

     L                 Change the name of the link.
     A                 Toggles ANSI stripping of incoming text.
     B                 Toggles display of linked BBS Name to local users.
     S                 Toggles sending of TOP colour codes to linked BBS.
     D                 Toggles ability of local users to send text
                       directly to the linked BBS.

   Alt-J               Shells to DOS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             [ Commands for Users ]

By typing text as usual, TOPLink will send it over the modem to the linked BBS.
Actions, talktypes, profile editor enter/exiting, and many other things are
sent to the linked BBS.

Direct text can be sent to the linked BBS by a user by whipsering to the link
and putting a "*" before the text.
eg:
Rebel: /q *poker scan

Commands from the other BBS can be sent to TOPLink.  There are currently two
commands availible.  They must be enclosed with parentheses "()".

(TOP:WHO) - Shows who is in TOP at the moment.
(TOP:VER) - Shows version and copyright of TOPLink.

    The author of TOPLink wishes to thank David Ong for providing me with the
original source code and documentation for RAPLink so it could be adapted for
TOP.  David was too busy with university and related happenings to do this job.
I am immensely grateful to him that I didn't have to rewrite TOPLink and its
documentation, because it saved me months worth of work.
