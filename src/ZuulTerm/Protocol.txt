                            ZuulTerm Protocol v0.1


The ZuulTerm protocol runs on top of an 8-bit clean connection.

The Zuul protocol is a client/server protocol for session control data.
The idea is that a control connection exists where session data is transferred
and one or more auxiliary connections for stateless data.

The session is in UTF-8 mode at all times, and the string control characters are
used as defined in http://www.ecma-inte rnational.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-048.pdf

Data which is not a control character and not part of a control string is HTML escaped and inserted
at the end of the element on the current page with an ID of "terminal" (if such exists).

Keystrokes are to be send to the remote, and TODO - some way of passing text from onclick - TODO

U+0090
	Device Control String
	The contained string contains one of the folowing commands (case sensitive):
	GET <URL>
		Where URL is replaced with a valid URL.  The current page is replaced with the contents of the specified
		URL.

	8.3.27 DCS - DEVICE CONTROL STRING
    	Notation: (C1)
    	Representation: 09/00 or ESC 05/00
    	DCS is used as the opening delimiter of a control string for device control use. The command string
    	following may consist of bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14. The control
    	string is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR (ST).
    	The command string represents either one or more commands for the receiving device, or one or more
    	status reports from the sending device. The purpose and the format of the command string are specified
    	by the most recent occurrence of IDENTIFY DEVICE CONTROL STRING (IDCS), if any, or depend on
    	the sending and/or the receiving device.

U+009D
	Operating System Command
	Used to interact with the OS.  This is *not* a command line to run,
	but an abstract description of one.
	Not currently defined

	8.3.89 OSC - OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND
		Notation: (C1)
		Representation: 09/13 or ESC 05/13
		OSC is used as the opening delimiter of a control string for operating system use. The command string
		following may consist of a sequence of bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14.
		The control string is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR (ST). The
		interpretation of the command string depends on the relevant operating system.

U+009F 
	Application Program Command
	The contained string is JavaScript to be executed in the context of the current window.  Note the
	character set restriction however, the JS must be written in a subset of ASCII.

	8.3.2 APC - APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND
		Notation: (C1)
		Representation: 09/15 or ESC 05/15
		APC is used as the opening delimiter of a control string for application program use. The command
		string following may consist of bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14. The
		control string is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR (ST). The interpretation of
		the command string depends on the relevant application program.

U+009C
    String Terminator
    Marks the end of a string.

	8.3.143 ST - STRING TERMINATOR
		Notation: (C1)
		Representation: 09/12 or ESC 05/12
		ST is used as the closing delimiter of a control string opened by APPLICATION PROGRAM
		COMMAND (APC), DEVICE CONTROL STRING (DCS), OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND
		(OSC), PRIVACY MESSAGE (PM), or START OF STRING (SOS).

U+009E
	Privacy Message
	Unused, must be ignored

	8.3.94 PM - PRIVACY MESSAGE
		Notation: (C1)
		Representation: 09/14 or ESC 05/14
		PM is used as the opening delimiter of a control string for privacy message use. The command string
		following may consist of a sequence of bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14.
		The control string is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR (ST). The
		interpretation of the command string depends on the relevant privacy discipline.

U+0098
	Start of String
	Unused, must be ignored

	8.3.128 SOS - START OF STRING
		Notation: (C1)
		Representation: 09/08 or ESC 05/08
		SOS is used as the opening delimiter of a control string. The character string following may consist of
		any bit combination, except those representing SOS or STRING TERMINATOR (ST). The control string
		is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR (ST). The interpretation of the character
		string depends on the application.

Also, the following elements of the C0 set are used:
U+0010
    Line Feed
	Moves to the beginning of the next line.

U+0008
    Back Space
	Deletes the last character unless it is part of an HTML tag (such as <br>)  Essentially, this deletes the last
	character of the last line.

U+0007
    Bell
	Sounds the system beep.

U+0012
    Form Feed
	Clears the terminal output

U+0085
    New Line
	Moves to the beginning of the next line.
