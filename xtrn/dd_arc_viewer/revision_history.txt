Revision History for Digital Distortion Archive Viewer
======================================================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.06     2025-08-17   Now supports .example.cfg configuration filenames. Also
                      allows reading the configuration file from sbbs/mods or
                      sbbs/ctrl.
                      Internal refactor: Now uses dd_lightbar_menu.js for the
                      file list menu.
1.05     2023-08-08   Internal refactor of how the configuration files are
                      loaded. Colors in dd_arc_viewer.cfg no longer need the
                      control character.
1.04     2022-05-16   Updated to use the new Archive class in Synchronet 3.19.
                      Now has built-in support for the same archive types that
                      Synchronet has built-in (zip, 7z, tgz, etc.). Other
                      archive types can still be configured.
1.03     2009-12-20   Updated DDArcViewer.js to be able to handle command-line
                      parameters with spaces in them as single parameters,
                      thanks to a function posted by Tracker1 of The Roughnecks
                      BBS.
1.02     2009-12-18   Updated to be able to handle file names/directory names
                      with spaces in them.  This involves using a Baja script
                      to write the filename to a temporary file, which is read
                      by the JavaScript script.
1.01     2009-12-16   Minor update to the documentation.
1.00     2009-09-10   First general public release
0.99     2009-09-02   Beta test, pre-general release verison.
