This version of doorscan has been updated to work with the new pre/post 
xtrn modules, and a file locking issue that would crash webv4 has also been
fixed. A new webv4 module has been added. No other functionality has been added.

Current unfinished status of doorscan:
1. It will scan for door usage and display it on the web page only
2. There is no logon/terminal module to display door usage
3. The bulletin functionality was never implemented
4. The user preferences may not be fully implemented

-----

DoorScan is a utility to notify users of which externals have been ran, how
often, and by whom.

To function properly, doorscan must be used to launch all the monitored doors
on your BBS.  Integrating doorscan into your BBS is done as follows:

1. Add to modopts.ini under [xtrn_sec]

eval_before_exec=js.exec("/sbbs/xtrn/doorscan/doorscan.js",{},"pre",prog.code);
eval_after_exec=js.exec("/sbbs/xtrn/doorscan/doorscan.js",{},"post",prog.code);

(If you are upgrading from a prior version of doorscan, it should still work but the
preferred method would be to remove the doorscan.js run call from your shell and use
the above hooks)

2. Scan for new doors

The command to scan for new doors is:
/sbbs/exec/jsexec.js /sbbs/xtrn/doorscan/doorscan.js scan

You have many options:
-Run it manually when you add a door
-Add it to crontab (for Linux)
-Run it as a fixed login or daily event. Example:

	SCFG -> External Programs -> Fixed Events -> Logon Event
	Set to "*../xtrn/doorscan/doorscan.js scan"

-Add it as an external to be run manually:
	SCFG -> External Programs -> Online Programs (Doors) -> Main 
	-> Available Online Programs -> Add

	Name                       Door Scan                    
	Internal Code              DOORSCAN                     
	Start-up Directory                                      
	Command Line               ?../xtrn/doorscan/doorscan.js scan
	Clean-up Command Line                                   
	Execution Cost             None                         
	Access Requirements                                     
	Execution Requirements

	Intercept Standard I/O     No                           
	Native (32-bit) Executable No                           
	Use Shell to Execute       No                           
	Modify User Data           No                           
	Execute on Event           Logon, Only                  
	Pause After Execution      No                           
	BBS Drop File Type         None                         
	Place Drop File In         Node Directory               

3. Enable the web interface

For original web (ie runemaster), copy doorscan.xjs to your web root

For webv4, copy 003-doorscan.xjs to webv4/pages/More/003-doorscan.xjs 

For either web page, you may need to edit the load() line in the web page to 
point to your doorscan.js file's location.
