Hello, this is here, for instructions on how to make it so that if you
have takin the smackrod or Gryphon Moon off someone, because they've been
somehow cheating with it.. They won't be able to get it back..
Change `p99 to 5. You can do this by going into the player's account, and
going into longest variables.. The last Variable is 99, it says something like

VAR 99  Choked Mom?          0

Change that to 5 and voila. The user won't be able to get the smackrod..

Change it to 6 and they won't be able to get the Gryphon moon..

Change it to 7 and they won't be able to get anything!
(I hope you don't have users like that)

Okay thats how you do it..
