This IGM was written for use with LORD II version 1.01a+ ONLY it will not
work with lower versions. This is not an IGM that is too giving, but
can be altered by you to your specifications.

The first time I uploaded this IGM to the Official Lord II web site the
review was not very good. Because my IGM would overwrite a handful of
other IGM's. So I changed it and fixed a few bugs. Now it will be
compatible with other IGM's. :)

Quester allows your players to complete only 1 quest per day. The quest
involves fighting your way through a bunch of monsters to a "King" monster
which once defeated the quest will be completed. There is a reward at the
end of the quest only if the "King" monster has been defeated. 

There are 5 different quest screens in the game. 1 of these 5 screens is
chosen randomly and the quest begins.

After the release of Odin's Keep V2.00  I was inspired by a friend to
write another IGM. The inspiration came from a program that he had
written for Legend of the Red Dragon. This program allowed the sysop
to set certain variables that would control the amount of "prizes"
that the player recieved from any IGM. Thus fixing the buggy
IGM problem that many of us sysop's have faced.

So I set out to make an IGM for LORD II that the sysop could control, to
suit his/her own game.

Quester uses 5 seperate REF files that can be edited by the sysop, to adjust
the level of difficulty for the players.

They are as follows :

SPIDER.REF
BAT.REF
MAJIC.REF
UNDEAD.REF
GOBLIN.REF

All files above are neccessary to play the game and you must be careful 
when editing them. I would suggest copying them to a seperate directory
before you edit. They are easy to understand and edit. Be sure not to
change the main "flow" of the ref. For instance you wouldn't want to change
a spider in spider.ref to an elephant or something. :>
Stick to editing the values such as Defense, Weapon Strength, etc. of the
monsters to adjust the difficulty. You don't neccessarily have to edit them.

New in Version 2.00

I added a swimming pond, and moved the IGM screens around to make this
IGM compatible with other Lord II Igm's. Also did some work on the routines
and artwork. 

New in Version 2.01

Fixed bug that would allow players to blow their flute inside Quester
and complete an infinite amount of quests. Thanks to Gangster of Love for
this Bug fix.

Above all have fun and enjoy it. I know your players will !
