Slayer's Domain is my first IGM.  It has lots to do if you find the quests 
which arent very hard [to find].  It has shops and stuff too.  Send all bug
reports and comments etc. to bmondoux@geocities.com!  This IGM comes with
compiled .refs, they will have the extension .rec  This igm creates the 
following .idf files:  slayer.idf; coolness.idf; slay.idf; stable.idf; 
head.idf; done.idf; dead.idf; tree.idf; matt.idf  You must delete ALL these
files when you reset LORD2, or the IGM will not reset!  New version fixes 
continuity problems.

Thanks to:

        Bobby Queen:  For his awesome work on LORD2 IGMs!
        Seth Robinson:  For making LORD2
