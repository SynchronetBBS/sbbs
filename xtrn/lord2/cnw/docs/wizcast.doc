HISTORY:

v1.0
Original release

v1.1
Fixed the bug that allowed you to keep bumping into the guy who had the
treasure to get unlimited cash and gems.  We should have saw this coming.
:)  Bad Authors, Bad Authors. :)

v1.2
Fixed where a part of the Wizard.ref was left out in v1.1.  This came
from 2 people working on the file and sending it back and forth. :)

v1.3
Fixed up the outside of the Wizard's Castle and added a sign outside.  Also
changed the Giant Centipede to Giant Scorpion (Thanks Crystal).  And changed
the name of the files from WIZARD to WIZCAST to avoid confusion over another
IGM using WIZARD for Wizard's Tower.  Also included a patch to let those who
want to run Felicity's Temple along with Wizard's Castle since we both chose
the same page to put our IGM's on. This patch was originally did for the 1st
version of Wizard's Castle by Ben Tiefert, so I just left his information in
the file & redid the screen.  BE SURE TO INSTALL BOTH IGM'S FIRST! THEN THIS
FILE LAST!

SPECIAL THANKS TO:

Seth Able for LORD II itself without which this IGM would have been useless.
Mariam Dittmann for alpha, beta, and gamma testing!
Jane Queen for alpha, beta and gamma testing!
Behind Great Authors always stand their wives!
