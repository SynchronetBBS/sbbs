Before adding this if you already have Wizard's Castle installed please
uninstall it by typing igm wizard.igm.  Since this new IGM uses different
names you will then need to delete the following files from your Lord II
directory.

wizard.dat
wizard.ref
wizfight.ref
wizard.igm
and wizard.sav if its there.

Then you can re-install it by just hitting wizcast.  I have a batch file
to install the new version.  Logon and enjoy the enhanced castle!
