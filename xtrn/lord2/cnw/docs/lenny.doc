Description:

Ok v2.00 is a bit differnt from v1.00 instead of asking for a gift you
have to earn one.  You place a bet on a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with
Uncle Lenny.

Also v2.00 has been compiled using the new COMPILE.EXE by Seth Able.  So
to run Uncle Lenny v2.00 you need to upgrade LORD II: New World to v1.01!
