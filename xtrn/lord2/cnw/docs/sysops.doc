                      IceLord Keep (tm) v1.48 by Commando
          
                               (< 11/03/97 >)
          
          FINALLY an update/bugfixer to one of the first IGM's!! 
          Sorry for the long time. I have been busy. Keep looking 
          for my v1.50 sometime soon with the guilds!!! This is the 
          best and most complex IGM for the great game LORD2. This 
          takes the great idea of sethable and adds a little bit of 
          flavor to it! IceLord Keep takes over the old Runion Keep 
          and adds all new ansi screens with tons of new features 
          and programming behind it! You and your users will love 
          the feel that this "Keep" adds to your game's atmosphere! 
          Also new is the original feature of "Guilds" that will be 
          added soon! and as always this program is.. FREEWARE!
