______________________The Sword Castle v2.0___________________________________

Executing the file INSTALL.BAT will overwright the file QUEST.REF, the

QUEST.REF file included in this IGM package has everything the original

one has, it just makes an extra quest available from Aquaman at The Sword

Castle.
______________________________________________________________________________

You will automatically be making a backup of Quest.ref by using the

INSTALL program included in this zip. To execute it just type 'INSTALL'

no quotes. The install will change the name of your old one to Quest2.ref,

and The one included in the zip will be active until you decide to uninstall

it. If you decide you do not like the Quest.ref, just type 'UNINSTAL' - no

quotes to restore the old one.
