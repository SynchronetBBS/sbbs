                           Time Stands Still v2.01

    This IGM is will take players back to ancient Greentree before the 
Red Dragons slaying.

INSTALLATION:
    This is simple.  Use the IGM.exe provided with LORD II and the rest
will work itself.  This IGM is completely useless when installed on a 
non-registered version.  So don't even install if it's unregistered.

IDEA:
    The idea behind this was to create another IGM for LORD2 so I didn't
really feel like I've abondonned it.  This is the result.
    Now characters can interact in this Greentree from the past and 
now that the dragon is installed into the game, you get a lot more to do...
Including a chance to fight him!

VERSION:
    This is version 2.01 and this includes the Red Dragon.  It will chat
with players if you want.. or you can become the hero and slay the dragon
but I didn't make that easy.  The update from 2.00 to 2.01 was just an
error correction.
