------------ ToDo's in L2.EXE, not CNW -------------------------------+
1- When a player is deleted from the play data base, to run a check on
    ALL the *.IDF files to set everything to 0 for that &playernum.

2- need a LoRDANSi -> HTML converter. (I could try to make a REF to do
    this, but it complicated, want to try yourself??)

3- SysOp <-> Player chat! there is one, but only works on dial-up nodes
    or bbses that use com/ip or netmodem. Some reason lord2 needs a
    com port for the chat to work.

4- @LORDRANK figure out proper options if cant configure it, add options
    to customize the listing.

5- Make a possible command for writing "@"'s in a new file, something
   like @writefile, but will stop writing the file at @fileend or
   something.
    UPDATE MAR 1-2001 --I think this is possible using `s vars.

6- Make all NEW players added to end of player list, instead of
   always replacing "DELETED" ones, untill player #200 is reached,
   then  start re-writing "DELETED" ones. This will help out with
   problem #1.

7- Player stays on overmidnight sometimes do not get their new day turns.
