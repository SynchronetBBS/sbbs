
         --- Notice to IGM authors for iBBS compatibility ---

    Directories to be added in future versions for iBBS compatibility:
 /data/     = for all *.IDF and *.DAT files which are used during the game.
 /ibbs-out/ = files to be processed and sent to another node.
 /ibbs-in/  = files received from another node.

  Have ALL your data files to store any info about the player or game
  settings stored in the /data/ directory instead of the main lord2
  directory. This will make it iBBS compatible and the same time, easier
  to reset the game.

  Any file in the /data/ directory which gets modified in the game, should
  be copied into the /ibbs-out/ directory so they can be processed and
  send to other nodes.

  All IGMs already included in this version of CNW, I will make the
  apropiate modifications to include iBBS support, if you wish your
  IGM to be included in future versions, PLEASE make those new regulations
  to make it iBBS compatible.

  This version of CNW is NOT iBBS ready. The iBBS program is still under
  developement.
  If any other door authors wish to make iBBS programs, to handle the
  processing and distribution, please use these standards laid out
  here.
