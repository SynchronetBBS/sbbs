                      An IGM for LORD II v1.01a and later


Installation:
I know.  You are sitting there saying, "Where the heck is DESCENT.IGM?  What's
going on?" DESCENT.IGM is written by INSTALL.COM.  The reason for this is that
it is absolutely essential that this IGM be installed by the installation
program INSTALL.COM.  The reason for this is that the IGM requires GENRAN.REF
to be modified.  The original is saved as GENRAN.BAK for easy restoration.
If GENRAN.BAK already exists the installation will be aborted.

The install program contains a patch so that you may run Soda Machine by
MamooSoft Programming along with this IGM.  If SODA.REF is found then you
will be presented with a menu.  Select the apporpriate choice.

To uninstall, type INSTALL /U.  /U is the only command line parameter that
INSTALL.COM accepts.  GENRAN.BAK MUST exist for uninstallation to be
successful.

General Information:
This IGM will add a random event.  A fight with a Blue Dragon.  The player
must be level 5 or higher.  Once a player has killed this monster, this
event will no longer happen for that player.  If the player loses the fight
with the Dragon, the dragon will leave the player for dead with 3 hit points.
If the player runs, the dragon will most likely detain the player and carry
him to her lair for her babies to practice on.  If the Lair is entered in
the normal way, there is a 1 in 900(i think) chance that the dragon will find
the player no matter the level.  If the player loses that fight they will die.
If the player runs from that encounter, the normal routines will be ran.

Resetting:
When you reset your game type DEL CHILD*.IDF
This will delete the IGM data files.
