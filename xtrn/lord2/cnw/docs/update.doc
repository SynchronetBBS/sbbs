If you are reading this file then you must have unzipped the release
.zip file into a temporary directory which was empty prior to unzipping.

Your next steps depends on whether or not this is a NEW installation.
                                                   ===

Note that you must be running the following version of Lord II:

LORD II v1.01a

If you are running Lord v1.00 then you must upgrade to the latest version
or Lord II before you may install Global Registries.

NEW INSTALLATION
================

For a new installation, you need to start off by printing out REGISTRY.DOC
and following the instructions in this document on how to install Global
Registries.

UPGRADE INSTALLATION
====================

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Global Registries then you have
a few more steps which have to be made. Although you do NOT have to reset GR
as part of the installation there are a few sysops who have expressed this as
their plan.

SYSOPS WHO ARE RESETTING  read this:

Follow these steps to fully reset your game of Global Registires:

SYSOPS WHO ARE NOT RESETTING read this:
=======================================

SYSOPS WHO ARE UPGRADING FROM v1.09 ONLY! to ANY other VERSION
============================= ===== +++++    ===       =======

   There were major revisions done between v1.09 and all the other versions.
   You *MUST* complete these steps if you are upgrading from v1.09 to any
   other version.

   Make sure you know which version your running now. If you don't know, load
   Global Registries and look for the version number at the top of the Global
   Registries menu.

1) Take a full backup of all your LORD II files from your LORD II directory.
2) Type REGISTRY in your Lord II directory to Uninstall the map. This is req
   in this version because we changed a few minor things.
3) Copy the file UPDATxxx.ZIP to your Lord II directory.
4) Unzip UPDATxxx.ZIP answering YES to overwriting any files, if there are any.
5) Type REGISTRY in your Lord II directory a second time to re-install the map.

In LOGSTUFF.REF at the very end of the file find the code:

@if `s01 is T then goto readlog

 @routine warn_user in regadver.ref       <--- Delete this line!
                                          <--- Delete this line!
@#alldone

6) Read MCODE.DOC. Make the code changes to REFULES.REF, ITEMS.REF and
   GAMETXT.REF as outlined. It should take you less than 15min to complete
   these changes. Please be ACCURATE with you changes. It will save you lots
   of headaches in the long run. Also check and recheck your work. I have
   tried to make my docs as easy to use as possible.

7) The hardest part is over. Simply load Lord II, go into Global Registries and
   the automatic update utility will run and install the latest version for you.
8) Once the installation is complete verify the version number and installation
   date has changed at the top of your Global Registries menu to the latest ver.
9) Read the sysop release notes (GRSYSOP.RLN) for release information or type
   ! to read the Sysop release notes online which is different from the release
   notes the users can see.

If you have any questions, please consult the Global Registries doc files
(Registry.doc & Mcode.doc) or contact me at auzzi@bigfoot.com over the internet
with your comments.


SYSOPS WHO ARE UPGRADING FROM v1.10 or v1.11 to v1.12
============================= =====    =====   =======
   Make sure you know which version your running now. If you don't know, load
   Global Registries and look for the version number at the top of the Global
   Registries main menu.

1) Take a full backup of all your LORD II files from your LORD II directory.
2) Type REGISTRY in your Lord II directory to Uninstall the map. This is req
   in this version because we changed a few minor things.
2) Copy the file UPDATxxx.ZIP to your Lord II directory.
3) Unzip UPDATxxx.ZIP answering YES to overwriting any files, if there are any.
5) Type REGISTRY in your Lord II directory a second time to re-install the map.

In LOGSTUFF.REF at the very end of the file find the code:

@if `s01 is T then goto readlog
                                   This routine has been moved elsewhere so
@if dead is 0 then do                     <--- Delete this line!
 @begin                                   <--- Delete this line!
 @routine warn_user in regadver.ref       <--- Delete this line!
 @end                                     <--- Delete this line!
                                          <--- Delete this line!
@#alldone


This routine should end up looking like this

@if `s01 is T then goto readlog

@#alldone


In GAMETXT.REF near the end of the file find the code:

** This is the code we deleted from LOGSTUFF.REF and moved here **

  @if x < 1 then x is 27
  @if y < 1 then y is 7
  @if x > 80 then x is 27
  @if y > 24 then y is 7

  @show
  `k
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xentered`xthe`xrealm. all

  @routine readlog in logstuff.ref

  ;do end routines here
  @#endgame
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xleft. all
  @if dead is 0 then do
   @begin
   @do move 1 24
   @show

 Change it to:

  @if x < 1 then x is 27
  @if y < 1 then y is 7
  @if x > 80 then x is 27
  @if y > 24 then y is 7

  @show
  `k
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xentered`xthe`xrealm. all

  @routine readlog in logstuff.ref

  @if dead is 0 then do                              <--- Add this line
   @begin                                            <--- Add this line
   @routine warn_user in regadver.ref                <--- Add this line
  @end                                               <--- Add this line

  ;do end routines here
  @#endgame
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xleft. all
  @if dead is 0 then do
   @begin
   @do move 1 24
   @show

6) You shouldn't need to change anything else. If you wish though, you may
   want to read MCODE.DOC. It's a new revised version (SIMPLIFIED CODE CHGS)
   to our origional docs. Its less reading and way less coding changes. As
   I said no other code changes is needed to go from v1.10 --> v1.12.

7) Load Lord II, go into Global Registries and the automatic upgrade utility
   will run and install the latest version for you.
8) Check the version number and file date has changed at the top of your GR
   menu to the latest version.
9) Read the sysop release notes (GRSYSOP.RLN) for release information or type
   ! to read the Sysop release note online which is different from the release
   notes the users can see.
