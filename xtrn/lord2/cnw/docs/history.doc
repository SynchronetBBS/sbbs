     Descent of the Dragon  A LORD ][ IGM           History file

v1.50  Added routine so that the player cannot enter the Dragon's Lair more
       than once a day.  Also added provision that dragon encounter will not
       happen more than once a day.  Corrected a small spelling error in
       install.com routine that writes GENRAN.REF without Soda Machine
       routines.  Indexed DESCENT.REF for speed in execution.

v1.00  Descent of the Dragon released.
