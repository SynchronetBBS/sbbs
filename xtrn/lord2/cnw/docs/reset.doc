Reset Ver. 1.07

Changes from ver. 1.01 are cosmetic, no data will be lost
in an upgrade.

Change from ver. 1.02 Hydra reset accomodates players
with seth codes in their name.

Change from ver. 1.03, decreased the alignment change a bit.
Left the code uncompiled so it can be sped up with the indexer.
Made sure that I could find zero bugs.

Change from version 1.04 is bugfix and added Mimsic Isle to idf reset.

Change from 1.06 is a typo fix.

To install, unzip in the lord2 directory and type "igm reset"
(without the quotes) and press the enter key.

If you are upgrading from an older version of reset, first type
"igm reset",  press enter and then unzip the new version,
then again type "igm reset", and press enter.

Sysops, this IGM does nearly nothing in an unregistered
game or in a new game, as it is aimed at players who have
completed one or both major quests. This will never happen
in an unregistered door and may take some time in a newly
started game, so be patient!

There is a file, resetidf.txt, that holds the names of some
IDFs that will be reset when a player "resets" himself.
You may add to this file, one filename per line,
and have other IGMs reset for the player as well.
(Do not add reset.idf, it holds the scoreboard.)

NOTE:
Do not change the first line of resetidf.txt.
Do not put any blank lines in the file.
Edit only with a text editor, such as window's notepad
or qedit.


Why reset?

I finished both sides of the game and had done all the
IGMs that I was able to get in. <grin>  I decided that
I'd like to restart but didn't want to wait 15 days for
my character to be deleted.  Mostly, I wanted another
crack at the "Hydra" IGM.    <Vey nice IGM>

I decided to write an IGM that would let winners start
over and that would reset Fgrave and Hydra. While I was
at it I provisioned for resetting other IGMs that used
an IDF file to store whether they had been "done".

I felt that some "nice" people might NEVER want to
do the evil required to finish the dark side and so I
allow them to reset as long as they have done the Koshi
quest.   (I granted equal favour to the nasties.)

A scoreboard is nice, it's good to keep a record of how
many times one has won!

A bonus for those desiring to play over and over is that
retirees who visit their ancestors get to change their
alignment by 6 up or 3 down per day, handy for the turnaround!

Thanks for looking at reset,
