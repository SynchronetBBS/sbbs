HISTORY:

Here is the history of the making of Xena's House from right back in 1997
until revised later in 1999. All entries marked with an asterik (*) are beta
versions. I change the letter for DOC changes and and the numeral for actual
changes to the IGM. Will be updating the Hercule's House IGM soon and and
creating and interaction IGM between the two IGMS.

Xena's House Version 2.00  - Second full release with registration routine
                             plus a few bug fixes and cosmetic changes. Hope
                             to really distribute (you would have to be lucky
                             to get your hands on the last beta).
