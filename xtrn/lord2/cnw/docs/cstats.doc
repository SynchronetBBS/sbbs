II. Programs and Operating Systems Supported

To date Crystalline Stats supports the following software:

Legend Of the Red Dragon
Legend Of the Red Dragon II
Planets: The Exploration Of Space
Avalon - Live The Epic

Crystalline Stats runs on these Operating Systems:

DOS/DPMI          You need an active DPMI server or use CWSDPMI.
Windows 32        This will run on any Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000 machine.
Linux, *NIX       Statically Linked ELF Binary.  Should work on any *NIX OS.

There is plans for an OS/2 version.  Once a suitable compiler is obtained
this version will become available with all the same functionality as the
other versions.

III. General Information

Crystalline Stats is a program that will take the player information from
certain games and then create an HTML file that will list all the current
players and various information about them.

Minimum Requirements for all versions are:
Intel Compatible 386 or better processor
500KB of space for the program
Monochrome Monitor or better
640KB Minimum RAM

Other Requirements:
Windows   Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000
*NIX      Anything that can support ELF binaries
DOS       DPMI server such as CWSDPMI.

Note: Might require more RAM to run the DPMI server. DOS Specific.

This program takes a few command line arguments.  These arguments or
parameters will tell it which game to parse and where the game is located.

Usage: cstats <game> <path>

First Parameter ( game ):

 Option         Game Being Parsed
 ------         ---------------------------------
-lord           Legend Of the Red Dragon
-lord2          Legend Of the Red Dragon II
-teos           Planets: The Exploration Of Space
-avln85         Avalon - Live The Epic

The second parameter/argument is the path where the program is stored.  Some
examples of paths are as follows:

Windows, DOS, OS/2:      C:\BBS\DOORS\LORD
*NIX, Linux, etc  :      /usr/home/bbs/doors/lord

The leading slash (forward or backward) is not required.  Those are the only
parameters that Crystalline Stats needs.  If one or more of these are not
given or are invalid then the program will exit in error.

If you specify more than one game it will only use the first one specified.
Also, if you specify more than one path it will also only use the first one.

Note: Do not use <, >, or | in the path name since those are illegal
      characters.

IV: What The Program Does.

It will attempt to open the required files for each game from the path you
specify.  If the open fails it will exit informing you of the problem.
Otherwise it will read the player data and any other required information.
After all players are loaded it will then parse them to sort, usually
sorting by using the experience of the player.  Players are then outputted
to an HTML file. If any problems occur the program will normally exit or
stop processing and verbally inform you of the problem.

V: Files created by Crystalline Stats

Depending on which door is parsed, a file is created that is the actual
statistics file.  A list of the known created files are:

Game                                       Stat File Created
---------------------------------          -----------------
Legend Of the Red Dragon                   lstat.htm
Legend Of the Red Dragon 2                 l2stat.htm
Planets: The Exploration Of Space          pstat.htm
Avalon - Live The Epic                     avlnstat.htm

As games are added then number of outputted files will increase.
