What is new in V1.01a since V1.01:

* Fixed .EXE to automatically add .REF if needed.

What is new in V1.01 since V1.00:

* @prognam command works, now if you run BRADY.REF it will say 'Brady Bunch
  Adventure' on the status bar correctly.  (or any other program that uses
  this feature)
* (P)eople online function shows correct location for everyone.  This bug
  was related to changes in the loadmap function that were added at the last
  minute in V1.00...
* Ability to read compiled .refs.  COMPILE.EXE and .doc are included for
  developers.
* Changed ITEMS.REF so that you can abort a quest at anytime by looking at
  the 'sack' or whatever it is.  People were turning evil then Prince Corin
  would tell them to screw off and they could never finish the quest.
* Fixed .REF error while talking to Basil in arris.ref.
* Changed successfull to successful in quest.ref.
* One eye had ANOTHER @show where it should have been a @saybar.. wish
  I could blame Pap for that one.. ARGH!!!!
* Fixed Turgon.ref so you can actually complete the quest.  It's funny,
  people actually were like 'change line 127 to such and such, moron!' and
  they are right!!!!!!  Many people fixed this stuff on their own, that is
  cool that that is possible...
* Fixed problem where sometimes people would pop up on their bed on the map
  even though they were dead (they could be killed again)
* Unregged people now warp back home properly, a change had to be done in
  the items.ref file so it would change the X/Y cords BEFORE loading the
  screen, before, they could warp in a weird black place and magically
  walk to Greentree/etc.
* Changed stoneb.ref so that it gives 3 quest points when rescuing the
  parrot.  (it used to give 1 but SAY it gave 3)
* @Datanewday can Decipher &playernum ect for the filename now, it made no
  sense while the other data commands could and this one couldn't.

Well, that's about it.  Thanks to everyone for helping, especially
Ben Tiefert, Joe Orsborn, Ben Shadwick, Trevor Lemon and everybody else!!!

Also, be sure to hit Ben's LORD2 page, he has over 22 IGM's listed
already - hit rtsoft, then files, then the LORD2 IGM page link to get
there.  (cuz I'm too lazy to cut and paste his address in... but I'm not
too lazy to type a sentence to explain that?  Gawd!)
