1.0 - Complete New World
  This is a package set up for sysops that do not have the time
 to install many IGMs, and to keep checking for overwritting other
 IGMs. It is an easy way to have most of the GOOD IGMs quickly installed.

        >>>>>>  YOU MUST HAVE LORD2 ALREADY! <<<<<<<<
        >>>> JUST COPY OVER ALL YOUR LORD2 FILES. <<<

  Get the latest version LoRD2 v1.02 (L2102.ZIP)
    http://lord.lordlegacy.org/l2102.zip
    http://greenmachinebbs.com/lord2/files/l2102.zip

  There are 137 external IGMS included in this version, PLUS
 many other IGMs I have made myself, which have not been
 released individualy yet (only available in CNW)

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1.1 - What is it
   A compilation of the best IGMs for LoRD2: New World. Hence the name
  "Complete". Also includes many special features which can not be
  found for the normal New World. (see 3.2 and 3.3)

   In other terms, this is also a "Pre-installed IGMs Package".

   CNW is FREEWARE, and only FREEWARE IGMs will be accepted in CNW.
  LoRD2 is NOT FREEWARE, even though in my opinion it should be. :)
  Visit www.gameport.com for details.

   CNW is not LoRD2, its an addition of lord2, you will need a registered
  copy of LoRD2 to play CNW fully. $15 USD at www.gameport.com.

   CNW has fixed countles bugs from the IGMS which authors have not fixed,
  or will not fix.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1.2 - Who needs it
  I would say EVERY SysOp who wants LoRD2: New World on their system should
 have CNW.

  It has been made very easy to setup and maintain, that every lazy SysOp
 out there that does not want to have to worry about it, will NOT have to
 worry about it. :)

  Any SysOp who wishes to have many IGMs, but does NOT want to spend the
 many HOURS of finding good IGMs, installing them, then testing them to
 see if they will work properly with other IGMs that they have installed.
 CNW is already setup to handle many IGMs already installed.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1.3 - Paths & Files
    Description of some files and ALL directories in this version:

 /           = main lord2 files, REF and REC files. (removing REC's slowly)
 /RESET.BAT  = run this when you need to reset the game.
 /UPDATE.BAT = run this to update to latest version of CNW
 /INSTALL.BAT= Install a new CNW game.
 /MAIL/      = lord2 mail files
 /IGM/       = *.IGM files are here, so you can get quick info on any IGM.
 /NPC        = NPC *.IDF directory
 /regconf/   = registry config files  *REMOVED* (should no longer exist)
 /regdata/   = registry data files  *REMOVED* (should no longer exist)
 /docs/      = all the document files related to lord2 and the IGMs.
 /fonts/     = going to store the fonts here for various terms and such.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1.4 - Title Screen
  Humm, its cool isn't it? :)

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1.5 - Who done it
  Me of course. Joel Gathercole aka Greenie.

1.6 - LoRD2 Mailing List

    (we've added an igm in v136.1+ to list these places to play, to get
    your bbs added in next release, make sure you add yourself to the
    list on egroups.com

   -Files, you can get igms, and the most up to date CNW available from
    the files section.

   -Links, you can find useful lord2 links, not just CNW stuff!. :)

So, humm, JOIN NOW! :)

------------------------------------2.0--------------------------------------
2.0 - Installation
   Complete New World has been made to be extremely easy to install. You
 should not have any difficulties what so ever. :) In any case, you do
 have problems, simply contact me (see 1.5)

   You need a copy of the FULL CNW package plus any latest small UPDATE
 packages which may be available. If so, please run the earliest
 INSTALL.BAT, then the UPGRADE.BAT if you are upgrading a sub version number
 like 136.1 or something.

   You DO NOT need to download every small update package. Every update
 package i create supports all the previous updates.

   So make sure you have eg.
 CNW-1361.ZIP and CNW-1363.ZIP, no need for cnw-1362.zip in this situation.

   An easy way to see if its a FULL or an UPGRADE is the size, usualy the
 FULL is more than 2.2megs
 UPGRADE is less than 1 meg

   Complete New World v137.0+ REQUIRES LoRD2 v1.02. 

  If installing a FULL version like v137.0, I recomend you do a complete
 new install, not overtop of the old version of CNW. There are lots of
 files in old CNW that are no longer needed and just takes up space.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2.1 - Fresh New Game
   If you have just installed LORD2 original game, then it'll be easier than
 other ways of installing.

 Make sure you have LoRD2 v1.02 installed before you install CNW.

 To install a fresh copy of CNW, just run INSTALL.BAT 

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2.2 - Restart Game (Reset)
  It is recommended that you do restart a fresh new game if you have not had
 CNW installed previously.
 -run RESET.BAT (see 2.5 for details)
 -run L2CFG.EXE --> RESET GAME
 -run lord2.bat (no switches) (see 2.6)

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2.3 - Keep Game
  If you wish to keep the same game running, and have not had CNW previously
 installed, it is possible to do, but may cause confusion and players stuck
 in locations that do not exist.

  If installing a FULL version like v137.0, I recomend you do a complete
 new install, not overtop of the old one. There are lots of files in old
 CNW that are no longer needed and just takes up space.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2.4 - Upgrade CNW Game

  To upgrade from a previous version of CNW, run UPGRADE.BAT

  This will not automaticly RESET your game, but, it is recomended to run
 RESET.BAT after upgrading.

  Make sure you edit/check the RULES.REF for the games default settings,
 everytime you upgrade CNW, this file is overwriten, because of changes
 within this file are needed for most upgrades.

  Upgrading from v136.* to v137.0 should be a complete new INSTALL, there
 are lots of files no longer needed from the old CNW version, and will
 take up space.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2.5 - RESET.BAT
  This is a batch file which I spent a long time verifing that ALL the
 data files used in as many IGMs as I could get my hands on, datafiles
 were being deleted properly. It also includes some data files of IGMs
 which are not in CNW.

  Run this batch file when ever you want to reset the game. Thats it for
 a reset. ;)

  You also need to reset the game via L2CFG.EXE.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2.6 - 1st Player
  The very first player to enter a new game of CNW, will have a long wait
 for all the files to get created and updated for the world. It is HIGHLY
 recomended that this first player is YOU, the SysOp. This is so that the
 first player does not have to wait about 5 minutes or longer
 (depends on your cpu) to wait for these files to be created, and there
 are a lot of NPC files to be created.

  The UPGRADE.BAT or INSTALL.BAT will automaticly now try to run "SYSOP"
 after upgrading, it will in effect run everything that is needed to be
 run after install.

------------------------------------3.0-------------------------------------
3.0 - IGMs
 - I do NOT recomend you installing other IGMs on top of CNW!
 - I do NOT recomend you REMOVE any IGMs with the IGM.EXE program with CNW
    package! (see 3.4)
 - If you see an IGM which you do not like in the CNW, contact me (see 1.5)
    and I will look into the IGM to see if it is worth removing, also
    please specify map location of IGM and whats so bad about it. :)
 - If you want to know which IGMs are in included in CNW, check the
    /IGMS/ path and 3RDPARTY.DAT after installing CNW.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
3.1 - 3rdparty IGMs
  There are well over 137 IGMs included in the latest package.

  If you count the number listed in the 3RDPARTY.DAT file, it will report
 much less. This is not 100% accurate, this is cuz some IGMs did not get
 listed when I installed, or they go removed, no idea why or which ones
 got missed. 

  If you were to count the number of *.IGM files in the /IGM/ subdirectory,
 It will show a more accurate number of IGMs included in the package.

  I have added and removed many IGMs, doing it both with the IGM.EXE and
 manualy. Also deleting the ?.IGM file in question. But, I also do not
 trust myself 100% that I have done the complete removal of each IGM I
 have removed from the package. I also have seen a few IGMs that did NOT
 have an ?.IGM with the IGM package. (non-map igms, .ref only, and my IGMs)

  Therefor, the actual number of IGMs installed in CNW is really unknown.
 I go by the number of *.IGM files in the /IGM/ subdirectory for the
 version number or each CNW package.

  Some of you may noticed I would say for example.
 "There are 136+ IGMs in v136.1 of CNW." Notice the "+" ;)

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
3.2 - CNW FEATURES
   This is a complete list of features in CNW that are not 3rd party IGMS,
 these ONLY can be found in CNW.

3.3 - <removed, merged with 3.2>
 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
3.4 - Removing an IGM
  DO NOT remove an IGM with IGM.EXE, it will not work, and it will cause
 way too many problems. I recomend that you use the world editor, and
 physicly remove the IGM from the map, then delete the corisponding REF
 files. (RTWEDIT.EXE)

  I do not think anyone will be doing this, if you must, I would like to
 hear which IGM you plan to remove, and why. If it's a good reason, I may
 either modify that IGM to better the game for the next release, or totaly
 remove the IGM for the next release.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
3.5 - NPCs
  Here is something NEW and very characteristic of CNW now. CNW can currently
 only handle a max of 200 interactive NPCs. Do not worry, this is far off
 from how many currently are around. (125 now)

  NPC profiles!, NPCs are very interactive, you can flirt, kiss, take out,
 bring with you, marry them and even kill them. Each one is different,
 and they change their attitudes as well as time passes and their
 experiences develope with the players. Some are greedy, theives and
 slutty, while others are very nice and hard to get, even JEALOUSY!

  Each game that is run will be different, meaning, you might be able
 to have a great time couting with the NPC in one game, while the other
 game, that same character can rob and hate your guts!

  NPCs have sexual prefrences, yes, some are gay, lesbian, or even bi, I
 was thinking of adding another beastility (animal)
 (only if someone requests it, I'll add it)
 It is possible their preferences would change without notice.
 
  NPCs can get lost too, if you see it mentioned in the daily news, then
 you've got a chance to go find the NPC and earn stuff.

  NPC Quests, sometimes they may ask for your help to bring them to
 a place to pay their taxes. Help them out and earn quest points and
 more.

  With NPCs you can:
   - flirt (take out on dates, marry,
   - cure them on VD (quest points here)
   - Other little quests they may ask for.
   - attack and kill (or kill you) :)
   - they can rob you if you are not nice to them.
   - give gems or gold
   - get information
   - and much, much more!

  In the future, by the time I complete this huge NPC project, there will
 be features such as, trade items, give items and rob them.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
3.6 - Fonts
  This is something I started way back when CNW had first been released.
 A font you could load with various programs.

  I am sorry, I only so far created a font for the LiTERM terminal program
 for DDO-F/X graphics.

  I do plan to make a DOS font, and a Windows Font which you could load
 at any time for any terminal program for DOS or Windows. I may need help
 on this. Not sure at this moment.

  If you have made fonts before or would like to help in making some,
 please contact me. (see 1.5)

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
3.7 - Make your own CNW IGM
  If you plan to make your own IGM for CNW, or have an IGM that you wish
 to be included in CNW, please follow this requirements:
        - MUST BE FREEWARE!
        - Must NOT be compiled in REC only REFs permitted.
        - Make sure it does NOT mix up with other map screens used by
           other IGMs. Check the CNW map, then use that map instead of
           the original New World map.
        - If you're adding NPCs, please send me the choosen NPC#, and
           profile info to include in CNW. Check these files for info
            TALK.REF     <- has a list of ALL NPC related files
            NPCNAME.REF  <- names and npc#'s already taken
            NPCMAKE1.REF <- npc profile info 1
            NPCMAKE2.REF <- npc profile info 2
            NPCMAKE3.REF <- npc profile info 3
            NPCMAKE4.REF <- npc profile info 4
            NPCMAKE5.REF <- npc profile info 4
        - If an NPC has a quest, please contact me with ideas, and I'll help
           you make it the proper way. :)
        - DO NOT OVERWRITE ANY CURRENT FILE NAME!
        - All data files (.IDF), must be saved into the /data/ subdirectory.
               (I'm still working on that IDF thing)
        - Tell me that you made it! If it's good, I'll include it in next
           release.

 If you really want, you may join the CNW team. please contact me.

4.0 iBBS LoRD 2
 There is currently developement for a lord2 ibbs program. As of now,
 this program will be FREEWARE. We do not have a release date yet.
 When available, this program will be distrubed with the CNW package,
 and mostly set up for joining our league. Will require to email me
 when this is ready.

UPDATE JAN30th 2000-
  We may not make the typical ibbs game, but the real time line ibbs game,
 a lot like the tw2002 for real time game. This will mean only bbses
 connected to the internet will be able to function properly. This game
 is more complicated to make into an ibbs as your typical game may be.
 There is still a lot of talk about this. Please send your comments
 to the lord2 mailing list at
 lord2@egroups.com

UPDATE DEC 2000 -
  I'm planning to drop iBBS support at the moment, unless there is
 any demand then I may try it again.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
4.1 - CNW iBBS LoRD2
  I've started a somewhat iBBS LoRD2. Your bbs MUST be connected to internet
 all the time in order for this idea to work. So far there are 3 boards
 connected to the LoRD2 CNW iBBS game, but is also currently still open for
 other individual users/players.

  What is it really?
  Its a telnet server running off syncronet software, and can be setup
 to only accept pre-configured boards to connect to the main server. Each
 BBS will then be able to recruit players from their own board (like any
 other iBBS game) and try to get them to join the same team, against players
 from other boards that are connected to the main telnet server.

  Contact me for details on starting your own lord2 ibbs league, in fact,
 you can do this idea for ANY door game! You just need a dedicated telnet
 server with a fast enough bandwidth. :)

 To join the CNW iBBS network, fill out the /DOCS/L2CNW.APP form.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
4.2 - iBBS IGMs    (do not worry about this yet)
         --- Notice to IGM authors for iBBS compatibility ---

    Directories to be added in future versions for iBBS compatibility:
 /data/     = for all *.IDF and *.DAT files which are used during the game.
 /ibbs-out/ = files to be processed and sent to another node.
 /ibbs-in/  = files received from another node.

  Have ALL your data files to store any info about the player or game
 settings stored in the /data/ directory instead of the main lord2
 directory. This will make it iBBS compatible and the same time, easier
 to reset the game.

  Any file in the /data/ directory which gets modified in the game, should
 be copied into the /ibbs-out/ directory so they can be processed and
 send to other nodes.

  All IGMs already included in this version of CNW, I will make the
 apropiate modifications to include iBBS support, if you wish your
 IGM to be included in future versions, PLEASE make those new regulations
 to make it iBBS compatible.

  This version of CNW is NOT iBBS ready. The iBBS program is still under
 developement.
 If any other door authors wish to make iBBS programs, to handle the
 processing and distribution, please use these standards laid out
 here.

------------------------------------5.0-------------------------------------
5.0 - Auto Update System
 The Auto Update System has been currently canceled.

 I'm very sorry for this and to those sysops who did sign up.

 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
5.1 - Manual Updates
  I now automaticly upload all the files from the /IGM /DOCS and the *.REF
 from the main lord2 path. You can manualy grab them any time with any
 http file grabber, if you wish to do quick upgrades which I recently make
 almost every day.

  The best way to check if i updated something, is by the date on the file.
 You can find various http grabbing programs to handle this, if you are
 so interested in doing it.

  "WGET" is a program for linux, I also heard there was a windows version,
 I would recomend using it, as its very easy to use. :)
 
 So set your grabber program to just grab NEW files that compare to yours.

 make sure you add the option to not grab ALL the files off my server
 (eg. wget -np http://greenmachinebbs.com/lord2/cwnfiles/)

 If you figure out the proper command line for any program, please send
 the details to me, so I could include it in here. thanks.
