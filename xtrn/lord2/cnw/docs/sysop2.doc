This is my second IGM I have made for LORD2 (My other being FLiNK'S HoWSe).
And this is my best one yet (I wonder why).

In order to install this, put the following files in the LORD2 directory

SL.REF (File containing text for this IGM)
SL.DAT (The two maps)
SL.IGM (The file that tells LORD2 how to install and remove the IGM)

And then type in the following:

igm sl.igm

It will change around the maps and give you a brief description.



Unfortunatly, because I don't know didley about this IGM (I have the UNREGIS-
TERED version of LORD2, I don't have a clue if this works!!), e-mail me to say
if it does (I'd love to know).



Anyways, to reach me, leave me an e-mail at:
ibf1047@infonet.st-johns.nf.ca

or via my homepage, which is at:
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Cavern/1680

Anyways, expect to see many more IGM's from me because they are easy to make.

Thanks,
FLiNK
