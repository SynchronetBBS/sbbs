This IGM was written for use with LORD II version 1.01a+ ONLY it will not
work with lower versions. This is not an IGM that is too giving.

Loki's Inn was a time consuming project for me. I tested and retested
before releasing this to the public.

I wrote it because of the lack of private rooms on my Lord II game.
Instead of installing a half a dozen castles or keeps in my game.

Inside Inn :

Koshi Innkeeper - performs name and sex changes.

Armor, weapons and goods dealer - only deals in game available stuff.

Bank - Convient banking for your pleasure

Hilda/Odin - depending on the players sex, players can flirt and if they
have the charm get experience.

18 private rooms, No single player can own more than one room.

9 rooms have teleporters.

What's new :

Last version - Loki's Inn Version 1.01
I revised this version simply to make good ole Bobby happy. He reviews quite
a few IGM's daily and I thank him for his suggestions. So now the majik
stone is no longer in the table but it is now a real live rock. ;-)

Latest Version - Loki's Inn Version 1.03
Simply put I goofed big time, in previous releases of Loki's Inn. 
We are all human aren't we?!?!?!?!?!?!?
It seems that the rooms weren't working properly. :(
Now they are !!!! ;)
Local (node 0) players must be aware of a certain circumstance in the
IGM. If you are trying to by a room at Loki's Inn and a message comes
up and tells you only 1 room per person. Visit Hilda/Odin this will
make it so that you can buy a room. If this still doesn't solve the
problem then either wait until the next day or run the maint switch
when loading Lord II example: Lord2 /maint then visit Hilda/Odin in the
Inn 1 time. Then you will be able to buy a room.
This bug is not in this IGM but is in the game itself, and DOES NOT
AFFECT REMOTE PLAYERS AT ALL.

I almost went blind doing the bug fix so have Mercy!
Thanks ring out to Jim for the bug fix of the year!

***New in upcoming release of Loki's Inn***

I'm going to add at least 18 more private rooms, can't be done you say.
Wait and watch. :)
