                              G-DOGG'S DISCO HALL

-= INTRO =-

G-Dogg's Disco Hall is an IGM for Seth Able's LORD 2 - the best door game
ever made in my opinion! Therefore, Hades Software and I felt inspired to
make some IGM's for it. And after that, G-Dogg's Disco Hall was born. It's
our first IGM. We will make many more in the future... If you encounter any
bugs e-mail us at KingsXe@aol.com. Thanks for choosing G-Dogg's Disco Hall!

-= INSTALLATION =-

From the LORD 2: New World directory type "igm disco" but omit the quotes.

-= NOTES =-

Look for other great IGM's from Hades Software!
