What is IGM.EXE?

It is a utility that install uninstall IGM's into LORD2 - without it, it
would be very hard because the Sysop would have to manually do it, or you
would have to include the whole MAP.DAT file and ruin any other things
the sysop had installed.

Things it does for you:

 * Provides a standard.
 * installs an IGM by typing "igm igmname.igm".
 * Can replace maps *AND* will automatically add the map if the destination
   block is empty.
 * Creates it's own uninstall data!
 * Uninstalls by trying to install it twice. (typing the same thing again)
 * When uninstalling an IGM, it restores whatever was there.  (note, if the
   map didn't exist before, it leaves the IGM's screen.. this is fine, even
   though it will never be used)
 * Updates the 3rdparty.dat file - this is just a text file used by the
   LORD2 help screen which shows which IGM's are installed.  If no IGM's
   are installed, it shouldn't exist.  (IGM will delete it if you uninstall
   the last IGM)

   A player can view IGM's installed in the game by hitting ?, then
   choosing 'Current Game Settings'.

 * When replacing/adding screens, you can specify if they 'show up on the
   map or not'


  ******* STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON MAKING AN IGM **********

  Ok, lets say you just made 'Bill's tavern' somewhere with the World editor
  in LORD2, and made it warp to a new screen that has the inside, and this
  has some hotspots that call stuff from bill.ref.

  And now you want to share it with the rest of the world.  Is it hard?  No!

  * Step 1

  Download CRAZY100.ZIP, this is an example IGM I made to use as a template.

  Edit CRAZY.IGM and rename it to BILL.IGM.  This is your IGM control file.

  This is where we tell IGM.EXE what screens to replace, the name of the IGM
  and any additional information you want the sysop to know.

  Look for the string

  igmname: `0Crazy Man's House `2by `0Seth A. Robinson

  and replace it with "igmname: Bill's Tavern by Joe Smoe" or whatever.

  * Step 2

  Go into the World editor.  Write down the BLOCK #'s of the two screens
  you use.  Next, while on top of one of the screens, hit E to extract the
  map.  When it asks for a filename choose BILL.DAT.  (it MUST be called
  this to match BILL.IGM)

  Do the same thing with the other screen - notice it says 'Saved as record 1'
  and 'saved as record 2'.  This is important!

  Now you have created your BILL.DAT file, which will be used to replaced
  the screen when the IGM is installed.

  * Step 3

  Now edit the place where you see

  replacescreen: 1439 1 show

  and change the 1439 to the BLOCK # to replace, and the 1 to the record
  # of the map to replace it with.  (it will read that from BILL.DAT)

  If you leave the 'show' this means it WILL show up on the players map.  If
  you put 'noshow' this means it will NOT show up on the players map.  (do
  this for inside houses, hidden things, etc)

  Make *SURE* you have a carriage return ABOVE and BELOW each replacescreen
  command.  Can't remember why that is important, or even if it is but..

  Optionally, you can add an

  installmessage:

  Anything under this will be shown to the user when he installs the
  IGM.  Always put this at the END.

  * Step 4

  Ok!  Time to test it out.  Copy bill.igm, bill.dat and bill.ref into a
  dir with a FRESH copy of LORD2 installed.

  Type "IGM bill" or "IGM bill.igm" (it will add the .IGM)

  It should say it installed ok.

  Next check the World Editor - is the map there?  Does it look right?

  It should have made a bill.sav file.

  Now type "igm bill" again - it should UNINSTALL.  Go check - did it really
  change the screens it replaced back to normal?  (remember, if there was
  no screen there originally, its ok that it is still the screen from your
  IGM.. it only changes REPLACEMENTS back.)

  If everything looked good, put bill.igm, bill.ref, bill.dat and a
  file_id.diz into a dir and zip it!  You've created your first IGM!!!

  *** Suggestions ****

  * Don't use any player or global vars.. save and load your own using the
    @writefile and @readfile commands.
  * NEW!!  Check out refhelp.doc and example.ref to see how to use the new
    commands @datasave, @dataload and @datanewday - it makes it EASY for
    your IGM to create it's OWN data file and keep track of wether or not
    a user has done a certain thing yet that day.  It can actually save a
    longint (up to 2.2 billion) for each player so it could be used as
    other player specific things you might want to save as well.
  * Don't include any .REFs that overwrite .refs written by me
  * Don't add new items and include the items.dat file
  * Check out COMPILE.DOC and see how you can compile your .ref work to keep
    it safe...

  If you break any of those rules, be SURE to note it in text in
  bill.igm - so the sysop knows.  He can compare it to his other IGM's and
  see if there is a conflict or not.

  Remember, after you make an IGM send it to my LORD2 IGM page!  Hit
