   This IGM adds a Coliseum in the Northlands. You get to bet on which
   monster will win a fight. The amount of times you can bet is limited
   to 6 per day.

   WARNING: This IGM is incompatible with The Bridge of Theives IGM and
            The Fishing Docks IGM, as they all use Screen 215.

   What's New:

   100 : * The IGM first debutes

   100a: * Fixed an error in COLISEUM.IGM which loaded
           screens 216 & 217 at screen 217
         * Fixed a few spelling errors
         * Changed the max bet from $10,000 to $1,000
         * Changed the monster variables from fixed values to random values
         * Limited bets to 6 per day, instead of going by gambles left
         * Added a Play Again option to the end of the fight sequance

   100b: * Fixed an error that would let you bet even if you had less than
           the $100 minimum, and would let your money go into the negative.
         * Added more monsters (for a total of 10)
