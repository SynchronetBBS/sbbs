In this IGM you are kidnapped by the "Blue Dragon".  You must solve all the
puzzles to get out.  They are not that hard, but may require some thinking.
I will put the answers in this file.  Once again the refs are compiled to
prevent my work from being stolen!  This is the third IGM
by SlayerSoft, the second by me.  If you like it (or hate it) please drop me
an email at slayer@calgary.crosswinds.net.  To check out all the lastest
versions of SlayerSoft stuff, check us out on the web at
http://www.crosswinds.net/calgary/~slayer.  This IGM is free for everyone.
Since it is not really worth it to copyright an IGM, I have decided to encrypt
the files instead.  Sorry to those of you who might want to edit for local use
but I have seen IGMs stolen, some artwork changed and then the thief putting
their name on it.  I hate that!
