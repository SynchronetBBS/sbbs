  I added maps to blocks 1345, 1346, 1347 and altered block 1355.  
  All I did was add a blue tree to the west of Greentree.  If this is a
  problem, go ahead and move it to wherever you like, but be sure to change
  the exit from the Woods to go to the new tree location.   
  
  Whilst making this IGM I edited the items.ref file and added to the items.dat. 
  file through the item editor. Just so they won't overwrite your files, I've 
  named them hitems.ref, and hitems.dat. Below are listed all the changes.

    
  ITEMS.REF
  What I did was add six items to the items.ref file. It's very simple to
  add them all. Just copy the following into the file somewhere, except
  of course in another function. (At the beginning is probably the easiest)
  Just highlight the following lines and cut and paste them across:

  ITEMS.DAT (You change info in this file through the l2cfg.exe files item editor!!)

  This is where the info is for the six items I added. You simply add this 
  stuff in by going into the L2CFG.exe file and accessing the item editor. I will 
  list all the stats for these items just as they are listed in the item editor.  
  It is EXTREMELY necessary that you keep the item numbers the same.
  (Unfortunately it has to be done manually and can't be copied across :( !!)
