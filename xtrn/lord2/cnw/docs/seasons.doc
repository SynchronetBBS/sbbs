        Season is an IGM for Seth Able Robinsons' popular door
game LORD II (Legend of the Red Dragon : New World ).


	This version is shareware.  You are entitled to try it out
for a period not exceeding 30 days.  If you find it useful, and
wish to continue using it, then you are obligated to register
your copy.  Be SURE to read the order.doc!  :)
               ^^^^

	You are also welcome (encouraged) to distribute copies of
the unregistered version, provided that all files are included, intact,
and unmodified and that you do NOT distribute the key file. Commercial
shareware vendors may distribute the shareware version provided
that they do not charge more than $6.00; that they make it obviously
apparent on both the packaging and internally that their customer has
not purchased any rights to Seasons, and that they are still
obligated to register their copy.

        Shareware CDROM producers may include the archive under the
same conditions as oulined above, with the exception being that
the price of their product may exceed $6.00
