1.
Install:
Just copy all files in the archive in your Lord 2 directory. Then start the
install.bat.
It creates a Jennie directory where all playerstats will be copied in.

Uninstall:
Just type igm jennie again !


2. 

It changes block 960, 956 and 159 in the mapeditor. It adds block 1441 to the
editor. If already have any changes on this screens or if the block 1441 is 
used then do not install this IGM because it will overwrite those. If you 
already done this then you can delete it by typing igm.exe jennie again.


3.

Go to stonebrook and talk to the darkman. He tells you to go to the stonecircle.
There you'll find the rest of the information.
