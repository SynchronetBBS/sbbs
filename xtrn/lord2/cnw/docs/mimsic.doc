History: v1.17 released February 1998

Changes from:

116: New monster after the pit fiend. A user killed the
     fiend(!)  His sister is as hard as gneiss.

115: Sometimes, the pit fiend guards won't pass you.
     One "do busy" instead of "busy" fixed.

114: Sometimes, you couldn't fight the Demons.

113: One bitset error message from jw-isle2.ref.  <sigh>

112: Sunstone and Shining Orb were mixed up in some places.

The Isle is reached by boat, departure from the North Shore,
a ways east of Sosen.


This is a very difficult IGM to finish.  I can't imagine
a player's stats being high enough to "win" but I expect it
will be done before too long.  (Note, it was done in January)

I know of a player whose stats are about 6000 across the board.
              <not tough enough for the last map!>

The monsters you face at the start are of the level of those of the
North Shore, not too bad.  The bottom 6 screens have only one toughie
to run from but north of these maps ... well, you will see.


There are several ansi pics in this IGM all created by Sandy Chidester.

Mimsic will take weeks to play through, though not too much time per day.
There are several "quests" that must be done in order and
some timed events that take a few days to become available.


The final 5 monsters ... most players will never best them.

They do provide a huge challenge for those who need a brick wall
to beat their heads against.   <grin>


I had a lot of fun writing Mimsic and I hope you all have fun
testing your characters out against the mimsical baddies!
