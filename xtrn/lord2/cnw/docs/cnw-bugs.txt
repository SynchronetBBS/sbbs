                 KNOWN BUGS IN LATEST RELEASE v137.0

+#---BUG-------------------MAR 17-2001-----------------------------------+
1      Sometimes, no idea why yet, the first player of the day does not
     get started as a fresh new day, the game thinks they sre still
     playing from the last day they played, meaning if there is no
     more turns left, they will still have no more turns left.
     
     There is a temperary and quick way to pass this; Just have that
     player quit and join the game again, everything should be fine.

UPDATE-FEB-5-2001
     If you run the "lord2.bat" as maint each night, this bug will not
     show up to the users.

     I need some more tests done on this, need more information. If you
     can see any paterns, please inform me.

2      The first player of the day does still run some maint, and will
     take longer than usual. (aprox 1min on 233mhz system)

     I've tried to fix this so they don't have to wait as much.
     The maint is suposed to run when you run "l2.exe /maint",
     but the "/maint" doesn't seem to work properly :(

      All the /maint does is advance the game by 1 more day.
     So, don't run this as nightly maintnence.
     Why was is call "/maint" then??

UPDATE-JAN-20-2001
     I've played around with the maint.ref and the rules.ref, now you
     must run "lord2.bat" with no switches to run the maint each night.
     Of course it would be good to run this right at midnight.
     What this actualy does, is loads up player "SYSOP" and runs a set
     of maintence routines. If this is not run, the 1st player in the
     game will have to suffer during the maintence routines.

UPDATE-FEB-5-2001
     To make sure it is ran, run the "lord.bat" two times. Yes two times.
     Why? cuz sometimes the bug#1 happens. Sometimes, not always. Its
     like random or something.

UPDATE-MAR-17-2001
     If you do not have or want a SYSOP player in the game, then you can
     alternately run "lord2.bat maint+maint.ref". This will only call
     maint routines then quit. It will actualy take the player #1 and
     use it, but not effect the player stats or whatever. Well it didn't
     before either. Its just another way of running the maint i guess. :)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
3      Sometimes when new users try to enter the game, they get the
     message "ERROR:  Cannot dataload record 0!".  Then the game returns
     to the BBS.

     I still don't know why this happens, but i've got a few ideas why,
     and working on those ideas. So far no luck.

UPDATE-JAN-20-2001
     I found one possible place this bug probably is. TAXES.REF. I've
     made the apropiated changes and hope it will not re-occur again.

UPDATE-FEB-23-2001
     It has not happened again, maybe i fixed it. Report to me if it
     still happens in v137.0+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
4      If you buy the Pouch of Documents BEFORE you open an account,
     sometimes the game will crash. But the player still gets the pouch
     when they go back in the game, and is left off where they were last.
     (in front of bank)

UPDATE-FEB-23-2001
     The Pouch of Documents is now used as an EXT ITEMS, and does not seem
     to have this problem anymore.
     Most likely fixed. :)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
6-deleted players
     when a player is deleted, taxes owed and many deeds owned by that
     player will for the next player that joins the game which takes
     the &playernum. As well as all the relationships with the NPCs
     will still be the same.

     This could be a bad thing and a good thing. It could mean the new
     player has inherited the properties + owed taxes (good+bad).

     Accept it for now!
