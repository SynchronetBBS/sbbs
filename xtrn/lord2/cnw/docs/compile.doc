
  LORD2 Compile.exe V1.00 by Seth.

  Have you written an IGM or World and you don't want others to be able
  to look inside it?

  Use COMPILE.EXE on your ref and people CAN'T do the following:

   * Look at the .ref to find hidden tricks
   * Change the .ref to make it easier/customized
   * Steal your work and copy it

  Sounds great!  Is it hard to do?

  Nope, just type "COMPILER.EXE refname.ref" and it will create a file
  called "refname.rec" without touching your original.

  Now, take your source (the .ref file) out of the dir and run LORD2, it will
  automatically load the .REC after it cannot find the .REF file!  If a .ref
  exists, it will always run that instead of the .REC.  (.ref is the source
  file, .rec is the compiled version.  Get it?  LORD2 can read both)

  ** Info and quirks **

  * SHOW SCROLL will not work inside of a compiled .ref.  The good news
  is nobody I've ever seen has used this feature, and if you need it just
  stick it into a different .ref file - you can mix and match uncompiled
  and compiled together.  As for as original LORD2 .refs, HELP.REF is the
  only one that uses it. 

  * Compiled .refs aren't really compiled.. they are encrypted.  This means
  they are not smaller or faster, just the opposite actually.  

  * Declare command will not work with compiled .refs.  I may add this
  later, it would really speed up .refs as they would not need to be
  'scanned' before running each time.  (although no one has built a util
  to add DECLARE statements to uncompiled .refs either, so no great loss)

  * I did a compile *.ref in the LORD2 dir, then deleted *.ref and manually
  copied help.ref into the dir (the one with the scroll scroll), and everything
  worked great but be warned that this is basically untested.
