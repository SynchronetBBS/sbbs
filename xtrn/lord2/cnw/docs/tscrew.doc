The only thing you must do manually:

type IGM TLSCREW.IGM

If, as I'm sure many of you do, you have other IGM's installed and overwriting
the ITEMS.REF or ITEMS.DAT would delete THEIR data, you must install the
following manually:

Ok, the lightsaber seems like an unfair weapon...but only people who can
find it (and that is a TOUGH thing to do).
It will most likely not be found by most, and even those who reach it will
most likely be very experienced players (the enemy's along the way are
tough)

And the Myphon Groon (not only a satire) actually allows for people to
transfer to any city of their choice -- however. This item is guarded by
Blando, who will be near impossible to defeat until a person has completed
the game...so...
With v1.03 I changed this: The Groon is easier to reach; however, for
everywhere a person transfers themself, their turns (divided by 5) are
subtracted...thus making the Groon only useful about 5 times per day!

Innard's Experienced Tower will actually give users EXP points (randomly
chosen between 1 and 9000) once a day...

Violet is located in Jabba's Hutt, as is Tira, as is Princess Laya -- all
of them can be flirted with and, if a user's charm is high enough, laid!

The drinks from the bartender do the following:

20,000$ -- gives a user 8 muscle
25,000$ -- gives a user 10 dodge
30,000$ -- gives a user +8 max HP

Burrito (brother of Greedo) is used in a similar fashion as that of the
treehouse. A user can tell Greedo to kill a certain user, and, if the user
has a run in with Burrito, then -- well, the user is dead...

When someone finds the screw in Cloud City, it will say, of course, that
they have found a screw. However, if they check their inventory, they will
find they do not in fact have a screw...this was to save precious ITEM
space -- a screw that would do nothing would be pointless to put it. So it
writes to screw.dat that the user has found the screw (NEVER run the daily
maintenance on this file, or they can find screw after screw after screw)
and then, if they chat with the sysops, they find The Loose Screw BBS -- which,
is not only a cheap form of advertising, but it also a great way to get
back to the IGM.

With v1.03, Dagobah is finished! It allows for random collecting of Yoda's
body parts, and then trading them in for prizes (all of which seem to be
pretty fair to me...if you disagree, mail me and let me know). As far as I
know, this area CANNOT be cheated -- there are no bugs so a person can use
it multiple times a day and what-not. I took every precaution. I hope it
works exactly -- I hate cheaters. If you find any bugs, in Dagobah or
elsewhere, let me know!

-----------------------

Files it creates (don't touch):

TLSLAYA.IDF -- used to tell if a user has flirted with Laya or not
TLSTIRA.IDF -- used to tell if a user has flirted with Tira or not
TLSVLET.IDF -- used to tell if a user has flirted with Violet or not
TLSSCREW.DAT -- used to tell if a user has found the screw
TLSINNRD.DAT -- used to tell if the user has used the Random Gesture
TLSWANT.DAT -- used to tel if the user has beaten the Wanted Man
TLSBUR.DAT -- used for Burrito's "who to kill"
TLS1.SAV -- used for un-installation
TLSINNRD.DAT -- This holds all the movie lines <g>
TLSBLANDO.DAT -- used to tell if the user has beaten Blando or not...
TLSYODA.DAT -- saves whether the user has Yoda's pouch or not yet...
TLSTURNS.DAT -- saves the users turns when they enter Dagobah for comparison
TLSTODAG.DAT -- saves whether or not the user has used his turns at Dagobah today
TLSYODA1.DAT -- saves who and who not to let into Dagobah
