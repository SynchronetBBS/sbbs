House of the Incredible Tensions (v1.00)

Installation:

Just check out INNS.IGM. It has most of that information. The most important
thing you need to know about this IGM is that it *DOES OVERWRITE* original
LORD2 .REF's.

If you have any IGM's intalled that have altered any of the following files
and/or REF title names, then I would suggest not installing this IGM (unless,
of course, you consider un-installing the other IGM and then installing
this one)...

The files this IGM overwrites are:

INN.REF
-------
@#MABACK
@#MA
@#MADOOR


PORTTOWN.REF
------------
@#INN
@#WHORE


BONE.REF
--------
@#INN


FLAGCITY.REF
------------
@#INN


STONEP.REF
----------
@#LODGE


CASTLE4.REF
-----------
@#DOORGUARD


ARRIS.REF
---------
@#INN

The new .REF's it comes with are:

INNS.REF
INNS1.REF
INNS2.REF

Files that it creates are:

NINN1.DAT
 NINN1A.DAT

Summary, overview, etc:

        This IGM basically allows ALL the inns in LORD2 to be purchased,
  owned, and run by the participating users. It runs in much the same fashion
  as Sosen Inn, with two basic new features:

        -The owner can pick toilet water.
         (What? What? you say. What is he talking about?)
         I'll explain. Whomever owns the inn can choose to have their
         toilet water made out of either Gold Potions, Red Potions, etc...
         Then, once a day, users can drink from the toilet to receive the
         benefits!

        -All the inns have whores! (Sorry if this offends)
         Except for Ma's Boarding House, all the inns now have whores
         just like Porttown. However, the best catch: whomever owns the
         inn gets to set the "sleep with whore" price.
         Basically, the inn keepers also become pimps!

Troubleshooting:

        Not sure what could be wrong with this yet. It's the first version.
  I'd say beta, except that I've tested it pretty well. If you find any
  bugs, please do not report them to Ben or whatever Lord2 IGM page you
  might have have gotten this from.
