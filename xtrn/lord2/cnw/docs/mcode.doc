  Code modifications document for Global Registries by Mike Freeman.

  While testing Global Registries, I found 2 bugs in Seths ITEMS.REF,
  in the stock version, that needs to be addressed. See my notes below on how
  to fix this bug. If your * NOT * running Global Registries, its still a good
  idea to make this fix to your ITEMS.REF file. You will also need my
  REGFIXIT.REC program which is called from ITEMS.REF.

  My L2BUGFIX.ZIP 12/29/97 file.
  Recently, I posted this file on the Internet and all over that handles the
  above problem. If you recently applied this patch then you can leave it
  as it is since there is logic built into my installation program that will
  either upgrade your files or install this patch for you. My installation
  program handles upgrading your REGFIXIT.REC file only, to the latest version.
  You will * STILL * need to check your ITEMS.REF to make sure the code that
  calls my patch is still the same as the code changes I have below. It should
  be, I have not changed that @ROUTINE call, but check to make sure yours is
  identical anyway.

  Code Modification
  =================

  WARNING: You must be running v1.01a of Lord II. If you are running v1.00
  I strongly suggest you upgrade to the latest version of Lord II before
  continuing. These changes are *NOT* for v1.00 and have *NOT* been tested
  under v1.00. Get the upgrade Services Pak 1 from Seths Internet site at
  www.rtsoft.com. The upgrade file name is L2SP1A.ZIP.

  There are only 3 .ref files to modify to get Global Registries installed.
  Those are RULES.REF, ITEMS.REF and GAMETXT.REF. It should take you less
  than 15min to make these changes. Please check and recheck your work for
  accuracy. It will save you alot of headaches in the long run.

  GLOBAL REGISTRIES has its own set of rules so ..........

  Ok. There is *NO* zip file supplied for this change. The reason we didn't
  include one is because you probably made changes to your RULES.REF file
  already to adjust turns per day, unlimited turns etc. Simply load RULES.REF
  in a text editor and manually make the change below.

  If you have to manually modify the code then:
                 ========
  Find the code in RULES.REF

  ;*** example of showing users a message ****

@do `v03 is 0  ;Can players die unlimited times per day?  0 is no, 1 is yes
@do `v05 is 3000 ;turns per day given to a player, 0 for unlimited
@do `v06 is 1  ; Make this 1 to activate CLEAN mode, this means 'dirty' things
               ; will not happen, like there won't be whores at the Sea Hag
               ; hotel
@do `v07 is 4  ; Max random quests possible per day

@do `v09 is 15 ; Level at which players can be attacked in Inns. 0 for never

@#NOMORE

                           =======================

  Ok. There should be a zip file in this packet called ITEMS.ZIP It includes
  the changes below. It does not include the changes to the item editor. You
  will have to load the item editor yourself to enter that information manually.
  If you have already made modifications to your ITEMS.REF file because you
  have installed other IGM's, then you will need to manually change the code.
  It only takes a few minutes! If on the other hand you have not changed
  ITEMS.REF just unzip ITEMS.ZIP over the top of your ITEMS.REF file. Make a
  backup of your ITEMS.REF before doing this.

  This modification will allow your users to retrieve Global Registies, by
  selecting the REGISTRY KEY item from the 'V' View Statistics option.

  If you have to manually modify the code then:

  This code assumes of course that your adding the Registry Item to Item#75
  in the item editor. Be careful now. If you load your item editor and find
  item (75 of 99) already taken, you'll need to modify the lines above that
  says @if `i75 > 0 then do and the line that says #item75, to the integar
  variable equal to the item number other than 75, in the item editor. So
  lets assume you load the item editor and find (75 of 99) already taken.
  Then move on to another item thats not taken and enter the information
  below. Then modify the @if statement and the #item75 line above, to reflect
  the number of your new item, in your item editor.

  Enter EXACTLY as shown! Below:

  LORD II ITEM EDITOR  editing item (75 of 99)
    (A) Name of the item  : `$Registry Key
    (B) Action String     : CLICK!
    (C) Used as armour?   : No
    (D) Used as weapon?   : No
    (E) Can be sold?      : No
    (F) Ref, if "Usable"? : ITEM75
    (G) Use string        : Use it to enter the registry.
    (H) Gold Value        : 0
    (I) Used only once?   : No
    (J) Breaks 1 out of   : Never breaks.
    (K) Description       : Non-Expiring Key. Try it out!
    (L) Weapon strength   : 0
    (M) Armour defence    : 0
    (N) Quest item?       : No

                           =======================


  Ok. There should be a zip file in this packet called GAMETXT.ZIP It includes
  the changes below. If you have already made modifications to your GAMETXT.REF
  file because you have installed other IGM's, then you will need to manually
  change the code. It only takes a few minutes!
  If on the other hand you have not changed GAMETXT.REF just unzip GAMETXT.ZIP
  over the top of your GAMETXT.REF file. Make a backup of your GAMETXT.REF
  before doing this.

  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR MOD#2. PLEASE DONT LEAVE THIS
  CHANGE OUT       ================

  If you have to manually modify the code then:
                 ========
  In the file GAMETXT.REF find the code:

  @#startgame
  ;do startgame routines here
  @version 99
  ;if version 99 or newer isn't detected, it will tell the player to
  ;upgrade
  @do `v01 is 1
  @if map < 2 then map is 155
  @if map > 1600 then map is 155

  @do write
  `r0`c

  Change it to:

  @#startgame
  ;do startgame routines here
  @version 99
  ;if version 99 or newer isn't detected, it will tell the player to
  ;upgrade
  @do `v01 is 1
  @if map < 2 then map is 155
  @if map > 1600 then map is 155

  @routine $init in reginit.rec        ;<-- Add  ;

  @if `i75 is 0 then do                ;<-- Add  ;`i75='s Item # in Item Editor
   @begin                              ;<-- Add  ;
   @do `i75 is 1                       ;<-- Add  ;`i75='s Item # in Item Editor
  @end                                 ;<-- Add  ;

  @do write
  `r0`c

  Remember to change `i75 (ABOVE) to whatever number you used in the item editor
  if you need to.

 Also, in GAMETXT.REF find the code near the end of the file:

  @if x < 1 then x is 27
  @if y < 1 then y is 7
  @if x > 80 then x is 27
  @if y > 24 then y is 7

  @show
  `k
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xentered`xthe`xrealm. all

  @routine readlog in logstuff.ref

  ;do end routines here
  @#endgame
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xleft. all
  @if dead is 0 then do
   @begin
   @do move 1 24
   @show

 Change it to:

  @if x < 1 then x is 27
  @if y < 1 then y is 7
  @if x > 80 then x is 27
  @if y > 24 then y is 7

  @show
  `k
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xentered`xthe`xrealm. all

  @routine readlog in logstuff.ref

  @if dead is 0 then do                              <--- Add this line
   @begin                                            <--- Add this line
   @routine warn_user in regadver.ref                <--- Add this line
  @end                                               <--- Add this line

  ;do end routines here
  @#endgame
  @do talk `0`n`x`2has`xleft. all
  @if dead is 0 then do
   @begin
   @do move 1 24
   @show

NOTE: As a added bonus, I have supplied the source to REGADVER.REF so you can
 optionally change the warning message sent to users who have *NOT* entered
 their registry entry, when they enter the game. For more information on what
 you can do, load REGADVER.REF into a text editor and read my notes. -Enjoy!

  Also, in GAMETXT.REF find the code near the end of the file:

  @KEY
  ;Give them starting stuff
    @do `p01 is 1
    @do `p02 is 10
    @do `p03 is 10
    @do `p04 is 5
    @do `p05 is 1
    @do `p09 is 1
    @do X is 27
    @do Y is 7
    @do MAP is 155
    @addchar

  and change it to:

  @KEY
  ;Give them starting stuff
    @do `p01 is 1
    @do `p02 is 10
    @do `p03 is 10
    @do `p04 is 5
    @do `p05 is 1
    @do `p09 is 1
    @do `i75 is 1                      ;<--- Add
    @do X is 27
    @do Y is 7
    @do MAP is 155
    @addchar

  Remember to change `i75 to whatever number you used in the item editor if
  you need to. All the changes above * MUST * be entered exactly for
  method 2 to work.

 Once you have completed all these modification you may continue with the
 rest of the installation and configuration:
                           =======================


 Continuing with installation:
 =============================

 3) Still at your DOS prompt type:
                  ==========
    REGISTRY

    This will install the updated map for Neb's road and install the Registry
    hut so your users can push on it. Watch for the completion message and
    make sure there were no errors detected!

 4) Log into your bbs and load Lord II. Do * NOT * log in LOCALLY!!!!!!
    What I mean by that is * DO NOT * run LORD2 0 from your DOS prompt
    to log in locally. You must log on your bbs like any other user would
    to access Lord II.

    Hopefully you have done all of the above correctly and you can load
    Global Registries either by pushing on the Registry Hut on Neb's road
    or typing 'V' from any map menu to access Global Registries.

 5) At any map menu, go to Neb's Road and push on the Registry Hut, if you
    used method #1, or type V to load Global Registries using the key
    method, method #2.

    If you cannot get the changes that you made to load Global Registries
    correctly, then go back and read the documenation again. Check and
    recheck your changes. Make your changes and re-run everthing.

 Configuring Global Registries
 =============================
 6) Once your sure you can retrieve Global Registries using the Method
    of your choice its time to run my installation utility that will
    configure Global Registry for you and make you the Sysop in the module.
    In anycase, you should already be at the main installation menu for
    Global Registries once you load it. Simply highlight option number 1
    that says INSTALL GLOBAL REGISTRIES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

    There will be a question asking you for a PASSWORD. This was added
    because we didn't want anyone but the SYSOP to be able to run the
    installation procedure. Imagine what would happen if you installed
    Global Registries and a user beat you to Lord II. They would be able
    to register themselves as the SYSOP in the module. So to prevent this
    from happening we setup the installation with a password option.

    The password is: NEWINSTALLATION

    Once you enter the correct password you will be given Sysop access in
    Global Registries. The module * WILL NOT * be activated till you register
    Global Registries on your system. Unless you register, this module will
    remain active but closed to ALL users including yourself.

    NOTE: While registering you as a Sysop a number of files will be created.
    Watch for the completion message.

    REGFIXIT.REC: If you downloaded my 12/28/97 patch to fix a few bugs in
    Lord II from the Lord II Internet site, not to worry. I have built in logic
    that will upgrade your patch to the latest version during the installation
    if yours is out of date. If you didn't install my patch of 12/28/97 my
    program will also detect this and apply the patch for you. Just make sure
    that you make the code modifications to ITEMS.REF as I specified in these
    docs above. Read Mod#1 or Mod#2 changes to find this fix!

    Once the installation procedure is finished you will have access to the
    main Global Registries menu. -Enjoy!

    To uninstall, type:
       =========

    REGUNDO

 Other things you should know how to do:
 =======================================

 Why did I create a 2 subdirectories? Global Registries keeps track of alot
 of files. I felt it would clutter up your Lord II directory too much
 and it would be an absolute nightmare to work out which files to delete
 when you wanted to reset your data files. Plus I don't have the time to
 list out every single file created by my program so I'v made it easy on
 you.

To reset * ALL * your user records - Registry Entries and what nots:
   =====
type at the DOS prompt:

cd\lord2\regdata

then type:

del *.*

To reset * ALL * the Global Registry System Files:
   =====
type at the DOS prompt:

cd\lord2\regconf

then type:

del *.*

But, I wouldn't reset the system files unless I was doing a fresh
install in which case i would delete everthing in \regdata & \regconf
followed by re-installing Global Registries fresh by copying REGISTRY.ZIP to
an empty directory then following the installation instructions in
REGISTRY.DOC on installing everthing fresh like you were installing for the
first time. NOTE: Doing this will also wipe out your activation code so before
doing anything I would write it down somewhere safe.
