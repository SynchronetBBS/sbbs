Greetings!

Hope you and your users are enjoying Seasons, and
that you'll register your copy if you are able...

The price is $3.00 plus a dollar to cover handling...

BUT.....

This is Ken's story, but I wanted to keep it just the way that it was.

Some years ago I was deprived of the joy of the
companionship of my daughter. (Kelly)....  Since then,
I've devoted essentially all of my community efforts
to the well being of all children....

So....

Sadly, there are many, many small warriors :) in this real
world of ours who will go without what so many of us take
for granted over the holidays....  :(

therefore, here is what I ask of you....

The next opportunity that you come across to donate to one
of the child caring charities, please give them an extra
few dollars That way you will save the $1 Postage.. :) IE: you do
not have to send me anything just donate to the kids. I recomend
going to a local mall and taking a star from the tree. This is what
my family does every year.

And now, seeing I'm sure you've done it...

You are registered.

And may you sleep well, knowing that you've helped!

The best of the season to you and to yours.

and...  Merry Christmas, Kelly

Bryan
