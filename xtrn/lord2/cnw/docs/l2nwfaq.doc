Chapter 1: Introduction
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  If you've downloaded this file, I think you know what LORD II is. If you
don't know what LORD II is, then... WHICH CAVE HAVE YOU LIVING IN? LORD II
IS LIKE THE HOTTEST THING THAT A BBS CAN HAVE!! *cough* *cough* *ahem* 
  Anyway, this FAQ should tell you most of the things you need to know
about the doorgame.
  Quite a few of you probably have not yet tried making IGMs, and may not
know what the LORD II can or cannot do. It's good to try, so you'd know what
to expect in the game. For more help, consult Seth Able (see chapter 8).

Chapter 1.2: How to get started
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Firstly, you have to create your charater. Decide if your charater will be
male or female and give him/her a name. LORD II uses colour codes similar to
those in LORD. Here's a list of them.

`1 is dark blue, `2 is dark green, `3 is dark cyan, `4 is dark red,
`5 is dark purple, `6 is dark brown, `7 is grey, `8 is dark grey, `9 is blue
`0 is green, `! is cyan, `@ is red, `# is magenta, `$ is yellow, `% is white
and `^ is black

  You can't use black in your name and in most other places. There are
background colour codes, but you can't use them much.
  Ok, now you start of in bed. Talk to your mother (the  further right of
the bed you're on). Do you wanna be good or evil? This is the time to decide.
Be good? Ask her for the pie. Be bad? STRANGLE HER!! :) Don't worry - she
won't die.
  Of course, I recommend you get the pie. Go outside, and go to the berry
bush (the reddish ±). "Push" against it, and you'll have some berries!
  Go back into the house and "push" against the table (the yellow ã). You now
have 5 gold. If you want, you can get the money before you go out.
  Outside, follow the road to the left, to the next screen. You'll find
yourself just outside the town of Stonebrook. Go in. There are a few shops
there, as mentioned in chapter 6.1. Go into the shop labeled "Grocery Store"
and buy milk. Go back out of the town, and back to your mother's house. Talk
to her again and give her the berries and milk for the pie. You should now
have a berry pie!
  Go back to the bush and pluck some berries. Press "v" for your inventory
menu, and highlight "Cluster of Wildberries". Press enter, and choose to
arm it as a weapon. Eating it replenishes 1 HP.
  Go back out of the village, then go down 2 screens. If you're getting
whacked up by a monster, just run, and go back to the town and heal if you
need to. Go into the hut 2 screens down from the town of Stonebrook.
  Talk to the man, and find out all you can. Give him your berry pie too.
You can get another one later. Found out all you could? Go to the wall on the
left of the house. Near the top of the wall, there's a secret passage
(chapter 4). Continue through the passage and "push" against the table. You
will get a heavy coat. Arm this item the way you did with the berries.
  Go out, and get another pie.
  If you have enough money, go buy a better weapon.
When you've got that next pie, go 1 screen down, then 1 screen left from
outside Stonebrook. Go in and talk to the hag nicely, please. Give her your
pie for her stew and taste it. You'll get +5 max HP. She wants her parrot if
you want to taste her brew again? Fine.
  Go back and get another pie, but you could get it later. You won't be
needing it for anymore quests (I think).
  When you have $50, go into Jack's restaurant from the purple tree on Neb's
road. Buy a gloworm, and put it in your pocket to save it for later. Go into
the condemed cave, 1 screen down from the hag's house. While inside, eat the
gloworm. The place should become "bright". Go up the path into the next
screen, avoid the snakes (ë) and you'll be in the next screen. Walk to the
2 chests and "push" against them. One of them will contain an ancient flute.
See chapter 2.3 for more on the item. Walk to the table looking thing, and
you'll find Hector the parrot. Get out of the cave.
  If you're good, set Hector free via the inventory menu. If you're bad, give
Hector to the old hag.
  Save up enough to get a short sword, don't bother about paying Neb much.
With 15 HP, a short sword, a heavy coat, face Neb and beat the heck out of
him. Run if you don't think you can win him.
  After that, continue past his road left 2 screens. Greentree and the rest
of the game awaits...

Chapter 2: Game objectives
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  The main objective in LORD II is to win either as good, or evil. Your
alignment tells you how you're doing. Let's say, 10 alignment shows that
you're nice, and -10 alignment shows you're quite evil.
  How to get good or evil? Well, it's actually quite simple. When you
get an event where you have to decide between, let's say, helping an
injured man or beating the heck out of him and taking his money, as
shown below.

 Ú
  You hear an injured person nearby.  Investigate? [Y/N] :
                                                          Ù

  Don't waste the opportunity to get or lose alignment! Choose yes and
the following will happen:

 Ú
  Aid a fellow traveler

  "Please help me!" the injured man screams.  His leg seems to have
  taken quite a blow.

Help the man out
Beat him and take his money
Leave                                                              Ù

  If you go on to help him:

 Ú
  You help the man, and with the first aid are able to get him on his
  way to a city where he can further heal.

  YOUR ALIGNMENT GOES UP BY ONE!
                                                                     Ù

  As you can see, you don't get much, but it's not always the case.
But if you decide to be evil:

 Ú
  "Sure I'll help you .. die!"  You slam him with your weapon, and
  after he falls unconscious you raid his purse.

  You find 250 gold!

  YOUR ALIGNMENT GOES DOWN BY TWO!                                Ù

  That's what happens. It doesn't always pay to be evil though. And the
rewards aren't always the same. Being good or evil doesn't only mean what
you do, but even say in some cases. Check chapter 3 tip 19 on how to gain
or lose alignment quickly.

Chapter 2.1: Being good
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  In the previous chapter, there's information on how to be good or bad.
But what can you do when you're good?
  Well, if you've made up your mind to be good, read this. The main
in LORD II as a good guy is to help the Koshi people. You can find their
cave far west of Arrisland, but you'll need the Cloud Sword and 100
alignment to enter. To get the Cloud Sword, you have to construct the
Skystaff, of which has parts you can buy induvidualy from travelling
traders, one of the random events you can find while travelling. (Find
out more from chapter 5) Once you do have the required, go to the cave
and show the statue your Cloud Sword. It'll let you in.
  Inside the cave, there are 3 other holes. The one at the top-middle
will lead you to a table with a moonstone (find out more in chapter 5).
the one in the middle, will take you to the Koshi marketplace. Some nice
stuff to buy there. The top-left entrance will lead you to the most
important place in there.
  Inside the sort of a room, talk to the person in the middle. Try to talk
politely. Then, you'll be instructed to talk to your mother. Do so, and
find out the truth. Go back to the Koshi cavern and talk to Dahma again.
This time, she'll tell you to get the Gryphon Moon back, but won't tell
you how. Go to Prince Corin in Arrisville, and ask him your favour. You'll
be brought to the Dragon Tooth island where you have to take the Gryphon
Moon back. Wear the disguise you have been given as soon as you land on the
island, just to be safe. Walk straight into the inner sanctum of the castle,
Go to the table, get the Gryphon Moon and get out of there! Go back and talk
to Dahma and Prince Corin. The Gryphon Moon is yours! (Learn more on the
Gryphon Moon in chapter 5) You will receive some experience points and
quest points on completing the game. Your triumph will be anounced in the
daily news, and you would have a white "K" on dark blue marked beside your
quest points in the player listing.

Chapter 2.2: Being evil
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Of course, if you don't want to be good, you can be evil. First, get evil.
If you meet up with the Dragon Tooth battalion, inquire about recruitment.
You'll be brought to the Dragon Tooth island. If it's your first time into
the castle, they'll make you fight with a captured Koshi warrior as a test.
  After you defeat him and get -100 alignment, you can go into the castle.
There's a weapon store inside, where you can buy some cool stuff. Proceed
into the inner sanctum, and talk to the man standing there. He'll introduce
himself, and if you have 100 quest points, you'll be sent on a mission to
steal the Koshi Smackrod.
  Go to the bar in Bonetown, talk to One Eye, and he'll send you into the
Koshi Caves. Try to get the Moonstone there (see chapter 2.1) and then go
to the top-left cave. Walk to the guy in the middle, you'll steal the
Smackrod. Get out of there, and look for the Dragon Tooth battalion again.
Go back to the castle and talk to the Dragon Tooth leader. He'll let you
keep the Smackrod (Check it out in chapter 5) and will get some experience
points and quest points. News of your deed will be shown in the daily news.
There will be a black "D" on dark red marked beside your quest points in the
player listing.

  Note: You can win BOTH endings! And get BOTH the Gryphon Moon and the
        Smackrod! Your character will not be reset after winning.

Chapter 2.3: Other quests
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Other than winning the game, good or evil, there are a few other quests to
do. The berry pie is quite useful, as you would find out soon enough.
  One of the simpler quests, is finding Hector the parrot in the condemned
cave. Can't see in there? Get a gloworm from Jack's Restaurant (get there
from the secret tree on Neb's road) and eat it while in the cave. Go deeper
into the cave and get the parrot, and the ancient flute from one of the
chests. The flute comes in handy later. Anyway, what you want to do with
the parrot is up to you, give it to the old woman to cook, or set it free.
  Anyway, about the ancient flute, find the music shop west of Arrisville,
talk to the guy there and learn how to play the two songs from him. Read
chapter 5 for more information on the flute.
  The next quest, is beating up Neb, when you're powerful enough. No need
to explain this one.
  If you find a little girl, bring her back to her mother at the Red Dragon
Inn. You'll get a little reward. Kill her, you lose alignment.
  South of Stonebrook, in the shack, talk to the old man. He'll tell you
who he is. Offer him your berry pie to learn more. The next thing to do is
get Barak's diary. It's all the evidence you need. You'll find it in the
house just beside the Greentree church. You'll need at least 15 quest
points to pick the lock and get in. Get the book from one of the chests
inside the house. DO NOT TALK TO THE PERSON THERE. Just get the dairy and
leave. Go back to the shack and talk to the guy again. Show him the diary.
  Another quest, sort of, is getting the mountain amulet from one of the beds
in Stonepass Lodge. Show the amulet to the mage at Snowy Pass and he'll let
you pass through his cave.
  One more that I know of, is in Ma's Boarding house in Greentree. Get a
room, go upstairs, talk to the girl there. Thengo down and talk to her
mother. She'll give you a letter and tell you to go to a hut somewhere
south of Greentree. Find the hut, get the people inside to come with you,
go back to Ma's Boarding house, and talk to "Ma".
  There are also little deliveries you can make by conducting business with
certain people. You'll be rewarded with a random amount of cash, and if you
finish the delivery in the same day as you start it, you'll get a random
bonus.
  That's about all for quests, some IGMs have quests, but I won't go into
that.

Chapter 3: Tips
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Things I think you should do:

1. Get that berry pie. It's useful! You can get another one when you don't
   have one anymore.
2. If there's nowhere else much to go and rest in the unregistered version,
   go to the treehouse. You can get the password by hitting a bird with a
   stone. It's one of the random happenings while you're travelling.
3. Before you get Hector the parrot (see chapter 2.3), put all else you can
   give to the old woman to put in her stew, then taste it. You'll get 5
   more maximum hitpoints.
4. Start a bank account.
5. Get a fishing rod and go fishing everyday. It's a great way to earn money!
   Sell your fish at the house 'o fish in PortTown. Each salmon fetches $50
   while each sparkling green salmon is worth $250! Chance of getting a
   sparkling green salmon is 3/16.
6. Level up whenever you can.
7. Try to do the delivery quests as much as possible, and finish each of
   the deliveries the day you get the job. You'll get a random extra bonus.
8. Bring along enough healing potions with you, always.
9. When something is happening at the Shrine of Babos, stated in the news,
   pray at the shrine. You'll get a little something.
10. Any items like old weapons you don't need? Sell them.
11. If you're getting pretty seriously hurt, heal as soon as possible. And
    If you're really getting whacked up in a fight, run! He who fights and
    runs away, gets to fight another day!
12. Know your strength. If the monsters in a certain map are too powerful,
    get out of there.
13. Decide if you want to be good or evil before you start, and stick to
    whichever route you choose all the way, until you've won the game.
    Remember that you can win both endings!
14. If you're going anywhere, check your turns. Decide if you should go if
    you don't think you can finish the journey and stay someplace safe.
15. There are lots of suspicious looking land formations in LORD II, but
    not everything is something.
16. Road are good, they guide you, but they don't save turns when you're
    moving. You don't have to follow exactly on them.
17. Read signs. They sometimes show you directions, or tell you important
    stuff.
18. Buy a map. It's good to know where you are and where to go.
19. A fast way to gain/lose alignment is to roam around Bonetown.
20. Make friends with other players. They may help and not attack you. It's
    good to know a few more people anyway. :)
21. Don't mind if you keep dying. It's a game, and it's all for fun! :)

Chapter 4: Secrets
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  A few secrets that you may not know of:

1. In Greentree, in the bottom-middle screen, there's a tree in the wall.
   You can walk into it and come out at the screen just below the city.
   Not much, but it's a shortcut. You can go in the same way.
2. In Turgon's shack, there's a secret passage, and it's further up on the
   left wall, as shown below.

                 ²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²² ²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²

3. In the screen above the little hut as shown below, there's a secret
   passage, the route has been marked, as you can see. There's a red potion
   (see chapter 5) on the table in the next screen.

4. Deep in the dark forest, in the picture shown below, there's a secret
   passage into a lair. Inside the lair, also shown below, has teleport
   spots hidden all over. I've marked the spots to go. Then you will fight
   a creature called Tash. Defeat him, you'll get a moonstone (see Chapter
   5). If you run, you'll be transported to some really strange place.

5. At the Stonepass Lodge screen, go up the trunk of the big tree there.
   You'll get an apple.
6. In Stonepass Lodge, there's a mountain amulet under one of the beds. See
   chapter 2.3 for more on this.
7. There's a little passage near Castle Coldrake. The only way through is
   through the castle or with your Smackrod (see chapter 5). There are 2
   silver potions (see chapter 5) on the table.
8. Along the shoreline from Castle Coldrake to Sosen Village, there's one
   part of the shore that will extend into the next screen. Go there, and
   you'll find a tree with a red potion (see chapter 5) in it.
9. Somewhere in Smallwood field, which is surrounded by Bigwood forest north
   of Sosen, there's a large purple tree. Walk into it. You'll be in some
   weird little place. Get the moonstone (see chapter 5) on the table.
10. In Arrisville inn, walk around a while and you might encounter a ghost.
    He'll talk to you and give you his ring. Go to the Rockholm Mountains
    just west of Castle Coldrake and find the old Red Dragon's lair (It's in
    the bottom-right parts of the area). Go into the cave and look around.
11. In one of the waterfalls a few screens west of PortTown, there's a secret
    passage, as shown. It leads to a moonstone (see chapter 5).

12. In Greentree, where you find the sheep, there's a tree on the right of
    the fence. Go just stand north of the tree and move west. You can go in.
13. In the house on the right, just beside Barak's house, there's a woman
    who doesn't want you to use her toilet. Check the bowl and you'll find
    a travel pass in it. You can use this to go pass the gate at Stonepass
    lodge.
14. At the massive tree near Stonebrook, there is a way inside. There's a
    small amount of gold there.

Chapter 5: Items
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  In this chapter, I'll be explaining the items. If an item has a "W" after
it, it's a weapon. If it has a "A" after it, it's armour. If it has a number
marked after it, it can only be used that many times. If it doesn't have
anything marked after it, it has some other purpose, and can be used forever,
without it running out or anything.

things. Don't forget to get a map (see chapter 3).

Chapter 6.1: Towns and villages
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Stonebrook:
  You start in your mother's house in Stonebrook village. Up one map from
the village there are a few more houses. Go a map left and you'll find the
treehouse (see chapter 3).
  From the main village, head left a screen and you'll find the town. Inside,
There's a pawn shop, a healer, a weapons shop and a grocery store. Empty
little place...
  Dock: no                   Delivery: no

Greentree:
  Pretty much the main city. This is where you have a better weapon shop, an
armour shop, a healer, a scribe where you make annoucements in the news, the
Red Dragon Inn, Ma's boarding house, the training centre, a church , a bank
and a few houses. There's a pawn shop near the road from Greentree to
PortTown.
  Dock: no                   Delivery: Bartender in Red Dragon Inn 

PortTown:
  As the name suggests, it's a port city. There's a fish related shop, an
inn, a healer, a bank, a boat ticket booth, a strange miscelaneous shop and
of course, a port. Of course, you could take a boat to some other places.
But there's a cargo ship which you can stowaway on if you have -10 alignment.
You could get caught though...
  Dock: Yes                  Delivery: Smithy in House 'o Fish

Sosen village:
  A quiet little village with a inn you can buy (see chapter 6.2), a bank,
a miscelaneous store and a few houses.
  Dock: Yes                  Delivery: Basil in top-left house

Arrisville:
  A small town with Prince Corin's castle, healers, a bank, a ticket booth,
a weapons shop and an inn. Prince Corin is an important character in the
Koshi ending (see chapter 2.1). There's a quest to do with the inn here too
(see chapter 2.3).
  Dock: Yes                  Delivery: Prince Corin in castle

Flagcity:
  Flag city is a moderate sized city, with a town council, a bounty office,
a healer, a bank, an inn, an apocethery (sells potions) and a ticket booth.
The bounty office is fun, if you have money. Watch out if you have a price
on your head...
  Dock: Yes                  Delivery: Nickabrick in bounty office

Bonetown:
  Not a really pleasant place to go. There's a bar, a few houses, one of
which is "different", a "funhouse", a healer, an arena, a casino and a pawn
shop. You have to pay admission fees, and you pay much more if you're a
good guy.
  Dock: Leaving city only    Delivery: Selena in pawn shop

  Some IGMs add cities too, but I'm not going to talk about that.

Chapter 6.2: Other places of interest
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Other than those cities and towns, there are a few other nice places to
go. I won't mention secret places though.

Stonebrook area
 Treehouse:
  This little treehouse is a nice place to sleep. No one can attack you
  there and it's free too. The only thing is that you need the password.
  You'll find it as one of the random events while travelling. You can
  also ban other people from the treehouse even if they have the password.
  There's a public chat board there too.
   Location: 1 map west of Northeast Stonebrook Village

 Turgon's House (see chapter 2.3, chapter 4)
   Location: 2 maps south of Stonebrook

 Condemned cave (see chapter 2.3)
   Location: 1 map west of Turgon's house

 Old woman's house (see chapter 2.3)
   Location: 1 map north of condemned cave

 Jack's restaurant:
  Cosy little restaurant. Order food! (see chapter 2.3)
   Location: 1 map north of Neb's road through purple tree

Greentree area
 Shrine of Babos (see chapter 3)
   Location: 3 maps west of pawn shop near Greentree

 Runion Keep:                              
  A ruined keep, with a safe, two beds and a doorguard. Sells for $3,000.
   Location: 1 map north of Greentree, then 2 maps west

 Cabin (see chapter 2.3)
   Location: 2 maps south of Greentree, then 1 map south-west

PortTown area
 Fishing dock:
  A place for fishing (see chapter 3).  
   Location: 2 maps south of PortTown

 Waterfall:
  Another place for fishing (see chapter 3).
   Location: 1 map south-west of PortTown

Stonepass Lodge area
 Glimmering pond:
  Another place for fishing (see chapter 3).

 Castle Coldrake:
  A small castle with a safe, a healer (free), stables where you can ride
  to Sosen village, Stonepass Lodge and PortTown and a traditional doorguard.
  There are 2 entrances/exits to the castle, one of them leading to a little
  hut (see chapter 4). Sells for $20,000.
   Location: 7 maps north of Stonepass Lodge

 Rockholm mountains:
  A maze of mountains, in which contains the old Red Dragon's lair (see
  chapter 4).
   Location: 1 map west of Castle Coldrake
             10 map area

Sosen village area
 Ferry terminal:
  For taking a ferry over to Arrisland ferry terminal.
   Location: 1 map north-west of Sosen, then 2 maps north

 Sosen inn:
  It is in Sosen village, and as I said in chapter 6.1, I'll explain more
  here. It sells for $40,000. You get a private bedroom with a safe, with
  the usual password options. You can set the inn fees, and when people stay
  at your inn, you can collect the money.
   Location: Inside Sosen Village

Arrisville area
 Ferry terminal:
  For taking a ferry over to Sosen ferry terminal.
   Location: 4 maps north of Arrisville

 Koshi mountains (see chapter 2.1)
   Location: 8 maps west of Arrisland ferry terminal

Flagcity area
 Wizard's Tower:
  Maybe the best built-in piece of buyable property, the wizard's tower is
  standing at 2 storeys high. In the first storey, you have the traditional
  doorguard, a free full healing fountain and a table. On the table there's
  a wizard's wand which you can use anytime, anywhere to automatically
  teleport yourself back to the tower. If you have the wand but someone else
  owns the tower, you can enter provided you have the password and it isn't
  set to not let anyone in at all. If you have the wand but nobody owns the
  tower, you can't use the wand at all.
  The second storey has 3 teleporters, one to Bonetown (red ì), one to
  PortTown (blue ì) and one to Greentree (green ì).
  It may cost $40,000, but I think it's worth it.
   Location: 2 maps south-east of Flagcity, then 1 map east

Bonetown area
 Snowy pass:
  A passage to the other end, which is near Greentree. It's shorter than
  through the desert. Of course, it could get shorter if you have the
  mountain amulet (see chapter 4).
   Location: 1 map north of Bonetown, then 5 maps east (Bonetown end)
             7 maps (full tunnel length), 4 maps (shortcut length)
             4 maps west of cabin (Greentree end)

Chapter 7: Question section
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Since this is the first release of this FAQ, I'll just put in the
things that I didn't mention and I think some of you newbies may ask.

Q: "How do I fight enemies?"

A: Just roam around certain maps. Places like inside houses and just outside
   a town don't usually have anyone to fight. The maps run a .REF or .REC
   file which contains monster information and other random happenings info.
   From the map editor, the sysop can change the chance of running the file
   per each step taken, though not advised.

Q: "How do I enter a town or building?"

A: Such buildings would have a different looking block, such as a black Û or
   Ü symbol. Or maybe you enter through the gap in a wall, like ÍÍ ÍÍ, the
   gap being the entrance.

Q: "How do I fight players?"

A: Well, you have to get on the square your target player is on, then press
   "h". There'll be a bar of options, like giving him money, items, writing
   a note and attacking him. If that other guy is online, you can go into
   chat mode with him. There are places, like inns, where fighting isn't
   allowed.

Q: "How do I level up?"

A: Go to the training centre in Greentree, and can train if you have enough
   experience points. You'll have to fight and win a random monster. If you
   fail, which includes running away, you can't try again until the next day.
   Don't worry about dying here. If you get beaten by the monster, your
   hitpoints will go down to one.

Q: "How do I cure VD?"

A: Donate 100 times your level to the Greentree Church. For example, if
   you're level 14, donate $14,000. You'll get cured.

Chapter 8: Other stuff
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  My other stuff here refers to credits and information. Don't ask for
"cheats", please. If you're bent on cheating, plead with your sysop to use
the player editor. :)
