                           The House of Dreams v2.00

    Welcome to my third LORD II IGM.

    To start, I will not be held legally responsible if this program does 
    anything damaging to your computer.  It wasn't designed to do so, so if 
    it does, someone messed with it!

INSTALLATION:
    This is simple.  Use the IGM.exe provided with LORD II and the rest
    will work itself.  This IGM is completely useless when installed on a 
    non-registered version.  So don't even install if it's unregistered.

IDEA:
    The idea behind this that I wanted to make an IGM using the @data codes
    and so this is was first attempt.  Now it use my animation sequences and
    better graphics along with my new InterIGM features to make it better.

VERSION:
    This is version 2.00.  This version is a long awaited update to my
    worst IGM to date(only 3 stars...).  Graphically better and animated
    sequences along with InterIGM functions.  Now thats what it needed.
