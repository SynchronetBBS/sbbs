This is the second LORD 2 IGM released by FPSoft. It is version

registration form and, if you'd like, check off the box for the latest 
version and we will send you the latest debugged version on a floppy disk.
If you give us an E-mail address, we will send it to you via E-mail if 
possible.

Thanks for choosing FPSoft!!

INSTALLING VIOLET:

2. type IGM VIOLET.IGM
3. There! Violet is all installed!

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Q: AAAAGH! I had an IGM on the screen where Violet's is and now it's GONE!

A: It is reccommedned that you install Violet on a newly installed LORD2 game.
   If you liked the other IGM better than Violet (C'mon, give it a chance!), 
   then simply uninstall Violet by typing IGM VIOLET.IGM Violet will then be 
   uninstalled and your original IGM will be restored.

Q: Hey! The girls can't flirt with Seth Able!

A: Of course, it was purposly made so that you'd register it to get that 
   feature, it's only $5, and we'll send it to you on a floppy disk, via
   mail. (We do use protective packaging, of course. And not only that, it
   is 100% recycled material, yippee!) Why do you think it is called just 
   Violet?


SPECIAL THANKS:

Special thanks goes to one person, Seth A. Robinson for making the kick-ass
LORD and LORD2 games. Live long and prosper, Seth!
