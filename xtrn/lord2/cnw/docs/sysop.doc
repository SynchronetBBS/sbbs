Most of you know what LORD is - a BBS door over 8 years old I originally
wrote on a Commodore Amiga.  It was funny and strange and did very well.

This is the sequel - some will be suprised to find it plays completly
different, although it contains many of the same characters.

Here is why:

   This game is FREAKIN' huge.

   It is a large zelda type world that lets players roam about as enemies or
   friends.

The entire game runs under a nifty engine - this gaming engine is what
is special - it allows people run walk around in the same world.  It uses
clock based timing to communicate by HD through tiny, tiny files.  For
instance, the locations of all players are in one tiny file.

This tiny file is read and written very quickly using advanced file
locking techniques.  It is recommended you use a disk cache such as
Smartdrv.exe or things will run entirely too slow.

The engine is smart enough to NOT draw every single movement other players
are making - if a player is moving quickly, it will still draw him at the
same rate, making the game playable, even at 2400 baud.  And of course,
the engine will not redraw players unless they have moved.

You can CHANGE how quicky it 'polls' the HD from the Game Options in
L2CFG.EXE.  (100 is one second, which is standard.  Set to 50 to poll
twice as fast, player movement will be more acurate, but require more
computer muscle)

  Some of LORD2 many features:

  * It's an ANSI graphical MUD
  * It gives a new meaning to the word multi-player
  * People can SEE other people moving around the map in realtime
  * People can travel in packs, follow each other around, show people
    hidden stuff, ect
  * Players can pickup/buy/sell and use items
  * Smart data recovery after dropped carriers and even lockups.
  * Swear checking
  * Players can GIVE items/money to other players offline or online
  * Players can 1 on 1 chat in realtime, or use globals so everyone can see
  * NPC's can travel with you (sort of), and you can talk to them
  * It is possible to do things like buy a castle or hold and live in it!
  * IGM support with drop in maps
  * A huge and interesting world filled with lots of story and uniqueness
  * Sort of sick and twisted
  * Regular and adventure mode (unlimited lives, no turn limits)
  * Turns per day, clean mode and more can be set by editting RULES.REF with
    a text editor
  * Unlimited worlds and quests can be added, either by you or you can
    download other peoples work
  * Creates bulletin outputs as SCORE.ANS and SCORE.TXT each time someone
    'lists players'.
  * 1000 levels
  * Only $15 to register

  Features creative people with time would be interested in:

  * Complete easy to use map editor, up to 2 million locations
  * LORD II's innards are completely built with the the .REF system, this
    means you can edit them in any way you want
  * The RTREADER .REF system has had a major overhaul and is inside the engine
  * Item editor
  * Add as many quests and characters as you want
  * EVERYTHING can be changed, even the player ranking format or stat screen
  * You can distribute your own 'world' to other LORD II users
  * You could make your own addon pack that is a different game completely
    (get 'The Brady Bunch Adventure' from somewhere, it is an example of
    what this .ref system can do working as a whole different game)


  Until you register, you can only access only a small portion of the game.

  (this file contains the registered version too, you can unlock it by
  purchasing a registration code - in minutes over the phone even!)

  REGISTERED FEATURES:

   * Can use more items, weapons and armour.
   * Over 300 new map screens
   * Will work with larger IGM's
   * PortTown
   * Flagcity
   * Sosen Village
   * Arrisville
   * Quest2000 random quest engine
   * The Lodge
   * Bounty hunting, players and NPC bounty hunters
   * Slots and craps at the Bonetown casino
   * Several brothels, woo! (unless in clean mode)
   * Game can be won 2 ways, good and evil.  Or even both...
   * When someone wins, the game is NOT reset - instead they get special
     powers and can continue to rule the game
   * Polar regions, mountain areas, ect.
   * Sleep at many different inns
   * 4 ownable landmarks some with special abilities - unregistered only
     one.
   * All future upgrades to DOS LORD2: New World will be FREE for you!
   * Everyone will be mailed a hardcopy with their code on it for safe
     keeping
   * You'll be supporting shareware - this means we will love you, and
     will keep adding to the game.

*****NOTE:  To change rule settings for LORD2 (including TURNS PER DAY), you
            must edit the RULES.REF file with a text editor.
            

Ok - First you will want to know what the game looks like and if it works.

Here is how to play it locally:

From DOS type:

LORD2

That is it.  It will give you the name of SYSOP automatically.

To test it out multinode locally under Win95, DV or OS/2:

Open a window and run "LORD2", get into the game.

Open ANOTHER window and run "LORD2 /L", this will prompt you for
your name.  (allowing you to make a new character)

Once in the game, you should see the second character pop up on the
first guys screen.  You are now enjoying truly multinode movement!

It is possible to play a game with friends over a LAN, as long as
everyone can play from the same guys drive, it will work.

To set it up for your BBS:

Well, if you've ever set up LORD or Planets: TEOS, this will be a
breeze!  The setup is identical.

STEP 1:

Run L2CFG.EXE.  Choose the (S)etup nodes option.  There is an option
to copy the settings from LORD or TEOS if you already have those
installed.

STEP 2:

Edit the LORD2.BAT file.  At the top, change the cd statements to reflect
where the LORD2 files are located.  (we want to move to the LORD2 dir
before running the game)

STEP 3:

Have you BBS run:

CALL LORD2 <node number> (ie:  "CALL LORD2 1" for node 1)

For multiplayer interaction to work properly, make sure each player is
on a DIFFERENT node #.  (Don't do "call lord2 1" for all nodes, actually
it would probably work ok now that I think about it...)

***** How to trouble shoot a problem ******

When LORD2 starts, it shows the comport, fossil driver info ect - if
you hit Pause right when LORD2 starts, you can make it stop so you can
compare it to your system and make sure LORD2's setup is correct.

(it doesn't show this screen remotely)

***** About the CALL statement *****

If you run it like this:

CALL LORD2

And forget the 1 as a parm, it will run as node 0 which is by default,
locally.  So if it keeps coming up in local move, this is probably why.

If you run it like this:

LORD2 1

And after LORD2 is played and the user quits, it stops at a DOS prompt,
this is because you need word CALL in front.  This will allow it to
be called from a batch file and RETURN when it is done.

Q:  What is the RULES.REF file for?

A:  This is VERY important - if you wish to see what settings can be
    changed in LORD 2, edit this file.  It's self explanatory but we'll
    go over it anyway.

Q:  What is adventure mode?

A:  It means your callers can CONTINUE to play after they are 'killed'.
    (instead of having to wait until the next day)

    Edit the RULES.REF file, you will see where to change the 0 to 1 to
    activate this mode.

Q:  What are 'turns per day'?

A:  Changing this lets you set how many 'movements' a person can do a
    day.  We've defaulted it to 3000.  6000 would mean they can play
    twice as long.  Setting it to 0 means NO LIMITS at all.

Q:  I've been playing locally and I want it to be the 'next day' and I am
    tired of changing the date!

A:  Heh, ok.. Add /MAINT to the command line when you play, it will cause
    it to advance a day.

Q:  I tried to play and it said "Someone is attacking you/giving you an
    item, try again later." but no one is?? What's up!??!

A:  On rare occasions LORD2 will make a mistake due to a crash or runtime
    error - it will automatically fix this 60 minutes from when it happened,
    just wait until then.  Or run ALLOFF.EXE, this will tell LORD no one
    is logged on, therby fixing the problem.

Q:  I noticed Swear Patrol is on.  But I love swearing!! How can I turn
    it off?

A:  Easy.. Same as LORD.  Delete the BADWORDS.DAT file or edit it to your
    liking.

Q:  How come I don't see an intro screen when I play with an (E)nter the
    realm option like LORD and all the LORD clones?

A:  This isn't a LORD clone.  As soon as the door is run, the 'adventure'
    begins.  I'm sorry it's unorthodox, but I kinda like it.  If you REALLY
    need an 'intro screen' you could easily add one - put it in the rules
    ini, it is run before the game starts.

Q:  I know LORD2 is incredible in how it can allow you to see other real
    people moving and all, but really, how many people could it support
    at once?

A:  Good question.  It communicates entirely through a complicated
    process of file locking, it depends on how fast your HD is, how
    well it is caches and such.

    Running over a network will work, although it will slow it down
    a bit.

    I have not done many tests, but if things are too slow, like you have 6
    people in and it is unplayably slow, then you will want to change
    the poll rate to 500 for read and write, this way it will only update
    every 5 seconds, thereby requiring much less disk access. 

    Setting the poll time to something really high effectivly turns off
    most communication - it will still play multinode fine and fast, but
    players will not see other players moving around.  (But it will keep
    track of who can attack and such, so it would work ok)

Q:  I already registered LORD, so I get LORD2 for free, right?

A:  No.  LORD2 is all new code and an all new game.  For this reason, I
    am charging for it seperately, at what I believe is a very fair price!

Q:  Yeah..  Um, I kinda like LORD2 and wanna buy it, can I buy 2 for $20
    like with LORD?  

A:  No.  No volume discounts are available.   (sorry!)

Q:  You make a lot of sexual allusions to goats.  Why?

A:  Goats are people too. ;>

Q:  Why the hell are you still making ansi games?  Why not internet winsock
    compliant client/terminal games?

A:  I'm a loser! Nah, I really like BBS's and the thought of local people
    getting together to game in the same world.

    Remember - the most important part of a game isn't the graphics and
    sound.. it's the game.

    This is my last contribution to the BBS world!!

Q:  What is the real story behind New World?

A:

I promised a game called "New World" a few years ago, I even put an add into
LORD for it.  At the time, it was half done - it was a futuristic game
that let you join a colonizing ship to go to a new world, and eventually
Earth is destroyed for some reason and this little colony is all that is
left.

Alien artifacts are found and sold, you basically walked around and
stuff, including flirting with this Natasha chick.

BUT:  I got bored and quit working on it.  I don't know, I got bored and
quit working on everything.

Two months ago I got an ever so familiar email saying "Where is New World?
I saw an add for it years ago!" and I snapped.  I said "Gawd damn it!! I
better finish this friggin game!!!" so I starting working on it.

A week later I renamed it to LORD II: New World.  Viola!  I got to work
with characters I liked in a world I liked and I also got to use
the "New World" engine (although I ended up changing it quite a bit) and be
true to my promise.

I'm probably gonna put up the unfinished New World game up for download
sometime in the 'Nostalgia' dir just so people could see what it would
have been like...

  About Greg Smith - he is a 19 year old college student who gamed with us
  regularly.  He started helping me make map screens for LORD2 - often.  Then
  one day he showed up with a brand new (and lavish) chair.  He then become
  a permanent fixture around here!! He is working VC++ stuff too. 

  He did ALL of the ANSI maps for the northern continent and most left of
  Porttown.  Without him the map would have been a LOT smaller!!!

  About Sean Teal -  Ok, he actually likes his named spelled Shawn but it is
  fun to give him a hard time.  He handles a LOT of the day to day operations
  around here including going through ALL email before I do and helping
  people get their reg codes.  He programs too!! He's 23.

  Justin Martin - Ok, he really didn't help with this project, but he is
  our artist and has been working VERY hard on our new game Dink Smallwood.
  Oh - did our LORD poster too! He's 24.

  Kurt Kim - He didn't help much either, but watch for him, natural talent
  like his is very rare.  He's 17.

  Dan Oliver - You may know him from the TEOS IGM 'Hippy Van', but he
  actually is working with me with Directx VC++ programming for new games,
  watch for his!!!  He's 18.

  Seth A. Robinson - I provide the electricity, moniters, keyboards and
  mice.  They bring their boxes and plug in!  I am also the project
  cordinator.  Recently I bought a building for us to work in, it has
  always been my dream to work with a talented group such as this, I know
  we will create great things. I'm 22.

And some others:

Jesse Barfknecht:  Helped to goof off.
Chris Navilio: He rocks!
My family:  For everything.  And for helping me move into my new house!!!

I feel like I owe so much to this people - most are skilling programmers
too and are also creating there own masterpieces, so I doubly appreciate
the time they took to help me with mine.   I will gladly do the same for
any of them!

Hundreds of others deserve to be listed here too, I recieved THOUSANDS of
bug reports about LORD2 - I really appreciate it!!!  It would be SOO
buggy without you guys!!!
