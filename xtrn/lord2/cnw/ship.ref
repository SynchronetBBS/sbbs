 `3The guard looks you up and down and decides you worthy enough of a reply.
 He proceeds to tell you about the splendid looking ship that is floating
 majestically on the ocean before you. He says:`\`\
 `2"The Sea Serpent is the pride of the Eight Seas. Never has she failed her
 captain. Not only will you be envied by all who live on The New World
 `#(Seth Able himself would give his right arm to own her)`2, you will also
 gain the following bonuses.`\`\
 `7Drop of points at `@FlagCity, PortTown, Sosen Village, and Arrisvile.
 `7Not only will she drop you off but the crew will wait until you are ready
 to depart.`\
 The Sea Serpent also comes with her own ship's surgeon and a secret vault
 where you can keep all your gold.`\
 `!Well worth the asking price of $100,000
