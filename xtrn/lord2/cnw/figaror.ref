`2     You grab a book called `0"Figaro's Secrets" `2!
     You open the book to a Random Page... it is writin:
 
`7                       It comes only before,
`7                       It comes only after,            `%@ @

`7                       But rises only in light.        `%@ @
`7                       It is always the same,          `%@ @
`7                       But is yet always different. 
 
`7                       What am I?
 
       This famous Riddle was past down from generation to generation!
       It was rumored that the inventor of Castle Figaro has hidden his
       laboratory somewhere within the Castle. But no one was able to
       find the entrance! Could this riddle have a clue?

`0     "A long time ago, I designed this whole castle and my Laboratory
     used to be the Main Engine room. But there was an accident and the
     engine exploded, toxic liquid made out of Behemoth blood spilled
     all over the room! But stupid me, I never told anyone about the
     location of my Laboratory, so I died of Intoxication... but as the
     years past by, I was revived by the gas... soon I hope to evolve
     into a Humanoid type form, first I was a Rat, then a skull... what
     could be next!?" `2he explains...

     I'm wasting my time listening to your life story!" `2you say with

     you already look enough like one!" `2the skull says with a grin.
