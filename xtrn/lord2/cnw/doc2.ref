        `3This game is simple!  First, you will be the head on the left side
        moving up and down.  When you are ready hit a key and it will stop.
        That will be your position.  Then, on the bottom there will be a bar
        going back and forth.  When you are ready hit a key.  That will be
        your power.  Red is the strongest and Green is the weakest.  The
        Stronger you throw the straighter it goes!  You will want to try to
        hit as close as you can to the bullseye on the dart board at the
        right end of the screen.  If you can 200 or more points then you will
        get double your money, otherwise you lose it.
