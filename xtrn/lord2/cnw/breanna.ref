  her body has long forgotten.  You feel her strength flowing into your body.

`r0`c  `%`r1 The Forest `r0
`\`\  `2You feel dazed and confused as if awakening in a strange room.  The
  last thing you remember was walking down the shore line in route to Flag
  City.  The armour and weapons you carried then are gone.

`k  Where am I you wonder.  Around you is a forest that seems faintly familiar
  yet you know you haven't been here before.  A strong odor is in the air that
  you can not place although it too seems familiar.  Looming in front of you
  is the entrance to a large cave.

`k  Without thought you start in the direction of the cave only to be overcome
  with nausea.  With each step the bile seems to rise higher in your throat.
  Somehow you know the cave holds answers that you need.  You spit and
  purposely stride forward.

`k
`r0`c  `%`r1 Inside the cave `r0

`2  The odor in the cave is overwhelming.  This isn't doing a thing to help
  your stomach and you fear you may loose what little food you have eaten
  today.
