        If you don't already have LiTerm, well, go and
 get it! :) it can be found at www.darktech.org in the
 Archives in "DDO-F/X" section, or at pcmicro.com in the
 "Door - DDO-F/X" section.

        Once you have LiTerm, and this font, just copy
 this font into the /literm/fonts/ directory, then load
 the font up once your in LiTerm by pressing F10, then
 go to SETUP, then FONTS.

   AND VOILA!

        Future versions will come out and it will be
 right in the font in case you are not sure which font
 you currently have at char#245.

 Have fun!
