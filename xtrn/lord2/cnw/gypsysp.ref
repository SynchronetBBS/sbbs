`c  `r1`%The Gypsy's`r0
  `!The poor local manusha of a neighboring village went to their governor
  and complained.  The rich drank to the accompaniment of music while they,
  the poor and destitute, could not.  Being sympathetic, the governor re-
  quested that 10,000 men and women who were expert musicians come to his
  palace.  Upon their arrival he gave them each a zen and a beautiful grast
  to put it on and to ride, and to the whole group a thousand donkey loads
  of corn.  All in the hopes that they would settle and farm in his kingdom.
  Being ungrateful the 10,000 men and women ate all the corn, sold the zens
  and grasts and left.  At the end of the year they returned to the kingdom
  hungry and tired.  The governor said to them "You should not have wasted
  the seed-corn.  You should not have sold your things!  Now you have only
  your donkeys!  Be gone from my Kingdom."  These men and women even now
  wander through the world, begging a living, sleeping alongside wolves,
  living like dogs, stealing day and night.  We call ourselves Gypsies!

`c  `r1`%Gypsy Familys`r0
  `!"Let me tell you a little of my family," says Marcel as he makes
  himself comfortable. "Ours is not any different than most Gypsy
  households. My romni, who I have been married to for over 20
  years, is a wonderful example of a gypsy woman. Even tho gypsy
  women are considered mahrime, the unclean, my wife being one of
  the oldest women in our household does not have to abide by those
  strict standards as the other women do. For example, my sons wives,
  my boris, must do all the cooking, cleaning and washing. All the
  men and womens things must be washed seperately you know. Anyway,
  not only does my wife, my sons and their wives live with me but so
  does my binak, who was born at the same time as I. Also my bhen
  lives with us. She was born when I was 6 years old. Oh what a cute
  little chey, what a beautiful little girl she was." You can tell
  Marcel is beginning to daydream so you clear your throat politely.
  "Oh, excuse me" Marcel says "Now where was I? Oh yes lets see wife
  ...sons...sons wives...twin brother...sister" you watch as he counts
  them off on his fingers. "Who is left?" Marcel wonders to himself.
  "My goodness! How could have I forgotten my mother?" he asks with a
  wink. "Just let me say..." suddenly Marcel jumps up. "Forgive me my
  friend but I have truly forgotten my mother! She is waiting for me!"
  With that Marcel runs off with a wave goodbye.

@#STORY3
@show
`c  `r1`%Gypsy Lifestyles`r0
  `!"As I am sure you already know we Gypsies are travelers, wanderers.
  Because of this we take great care of our grasts. Without our horses
  we could not survive. We value them more than any other animal. We
  make special zens and grasts. Our saddles are of the finest craft-
  manship and are made special for each horse." You raise one eyebrow
  questioningly. "Yes, it is true. We gypsies all have unique talents."
  Marcel assures you. "It is true we move regulary, but we only do that
  because we enjoy camping outside. Most of us stick close to the
  borders, hop-scotching across the borders to avoid being arrested as
  homeless vagrants." At this Marcel sighs heavily and then looks at
  you and smiles. "But as you can see we have adapted quite well. We
  often camp in abandoned or inaccesible forests so as to reduce the
  likelihood of being found." Marcel gives you his most winning smile.
  "So, please enjoy yourself here. We have so much to see, to do and
  even to eat! Please do not forget to visit Jeta. Even as fortune
  tellers go `0she is truly `2amazing." brags Marcel. You smile at him
  "Sure, Marcel, I'll do that." you say, trying to humor him. Marcel
  just turns away laughing.

`c  `r1`%Great Performers`r0
  `!"Do you see that stage over there under the big tent?" Marcel waves
  his hand vaguely in an northernly direction, so you look towards where
  you think he may be pointing. You see the tent easily enough but the
  stage?? "Over there!" Marcel says impatiently. You nod your head slowly
  even though you don't see anything. "That stage has traveled the world
  with us" Marcel says proudly. "On it we have performed for nobility
  and commoners alike." You look at him sceptically. "It's all true!"
  Marcel loudly huffs. "We, that is to say, my parents, and grandparents
  and my great-grandparents and all those that came before them have
  performed for Prince Vlad II, and his son Prince Vlad Dracul, also
  known as Vlad the Devil or Vlad the Impaler. I am sure you have heard
  of him? We have also performed for Stefan the Great, Pope Sixtus IV,
  Prince Constantin Brancoveanu of Italy and Prince Alexandru Ioan
  Mavrocordatos." You blink for a moment, not knowing if you should be
  impressed. Marcel looks at you and sighs sadly. "Well now we are
  performing for the likes of you. Don't forget to see the stage at
  night." Still not knowing what to think of his story you clap Marcel
  on the back and thank him for his time anyway. You think that you
  might just go and take a look at the stage after all.
