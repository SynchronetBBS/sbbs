`r0`c  `%`r1 Inside the well `r0

`2  Half way down the ladder makes a loud popping sound and you wonder if this
  is a wise thing to do.  As your foot touches the last rung you here a gasp
  behind you.

`k`2  Startled you spin around and ready your s&weapon expecting the worst.

`k`2  The base of the well is actually a large room.  Directly behind you is an
  opening leading off to the north.  Standing in the doorway is a small boy
  who seems even more startled then you, if that is possible.

`k
`r0`c  `%`r1 A young boy `r0

`2  "`0Please sir,  I didn't take anything.  I thought I heard my dog in here
  and I came down to rescue him.  I won't tell anyone what I saw, honest!`2" he
  pleads.

`k`2  "`$Easy lad.  I don't intend to harm you.  Now, what is this place?`2"
  You smile as you notice the bulge in the young man's pockets and suspect he
  may not have been quite truthful.

`k`2  "`0It is the hideout of some old bandit named Hawkmoon.  He use to hang
  out in BoneTown but no one has seen him in awhile.`2"

`k`2  "`$So what is down here`2?"

`k
`r0`c  `%`r1 A young boy `r0

`2  "`0At the end of the tunnel there are 5 doors.  Rumor has it that one has
  the bandit's main treasure.  I am not sure what the other four are but I
  have heard that one of them is a trap.`2"

`k`2  "`$What kind of trap?  Which door leads to the treasure`2?"

`k`2  "`0The old folks say that there is a ghost in there and that he won't let
  you leave unless you give him part of your life force.  Others say that the
  door has been enchanted and that once closed won't open again until the
  moon has reached it's zenith.  I don't know about that but I do know that
  the doors open on different rooms each day.`2"

`k`2  As you turn to peer down the tunnel the young boy darts past you and
  scrambles up the ladder. You smile with fond memories of your own childhood
  and start down the tunnel.
