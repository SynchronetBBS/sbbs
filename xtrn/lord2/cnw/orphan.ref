It reads `1GREENTREE ORPHANAGE`2.  As you push the door open, it squeaks on rusty
hinges.

`2     This place is obviously a relic of the days when the Red Dragon made
orphans of many children.  Now it is very run down.  The windows are broken,

is apparent that the orphanage suffers from a serious lack of funding.
