Herein lies the complete and unabridged collection of the wisdoms of
Princess Kiteria.  For many years I had heard stories of adventurers
who cheated the fates in their quest to destroy the Red Dragon.  In
the interest of Fair Play, I took it upon myself to learn the methods
used by these unholy vagabonds.  It was my intention to make their
methods known to all in an attempt to bring Fair Play back into the
realm.  I soon discovered that their cheating was being enabled by a
hideous force known as Igyembug.  In this tome I have compiled the
chants and prayers offered to Igyembug so that all may use them in
their quest for the dragon.
                             















`4----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`4`bNOTE FROM MAMOOSOFT:  `%There are some codes contained in here that cannot
be shown correctly by the game, as it interprets them as programming code.
Please remember that wherever you see an apostrophe (') in this file, the
cheat code actually needs a reversed apostrophe, which can be typed by NOT
holding shift when pressing the tilde (~) key.  I hope this is not too
confusing, but it was the only way to do this.  Now back to the IGM!
`4----------------------------------------------------------------------------









`2**ACROSS THE TRACKS**

`%In version 4 THE ORIGINAL, Find the bum, and give him 
some money. Type in -2,000,000,000 for your amount.  
You will be given 2 billion in hand.  The author 
repaired this with version 5.0.  The second version 
fixed the "old man" cheat but not the cheat that has 
to do with giving more money than you have to the two 
children in the Adoption Agency.  With this one 
just make sure that you bet and/or give more money 
than you have, and that includes everything in the 
LORD bank as well as in hand.  Exit the IGM, then 
exit the game, when you return you will have 2 billion 
gold in hand.

`2**ARAGON'S TIMER 1.0**

`%You'll need another player's cooperating with you.  
If you think that no-one else has played Aragon's 
Timer today, you should enter and exit the IGM alone 
without playing the game to make sure the data
file is reset.  Once you have done that, both of 
you should enter Aragon's Timer.  You play the game; 
your partner doesn't. You exit back to LORD first, 
then your partner exits to LORD (Precise timing
is a must, since you may not be able to talk to each 
other.) Now that you're both in LORD, it's time to go 
back to Aragon's Timer.  Both of you enter Aragon's Timer.  
Your partner plays the game; you don't.  Your partner 
exits Aragon's Timer first, then you exit Aragon's Timer
second.   The result:  If you're both good at Aragon's 
Timer, both of you have increased your wealth by 50%.  
Here's the cool part: if you followed the above instructions, 
Aragon's Timer will have NO record of either of you playing 
the game!   That's right...both of you can go back and 
play Aragon's Timer FOREVER!...or until you run out of
time...or the SysOp catches you.  :)   This worked for 
me locally under Aragon's Timer 1.0. (I had two LORD games 
running under two different windows in win3.11.)  I don't 
know of any updates to Aragon's Timer. 

`2**ALADDIN'S PALACE**
`%**::UPDATE FROM STANLEY CHIU...the Gentleman Genius::**

The 's  code has never worked in ALADDIN'S PALACE not even in
version 1.25 and older. (Mike Neale also told me this, I just
did not click to what I was being told. SF)  First of all, I'll
elaborate on the weapon/armor situation. If you sell your weapon,
you'll get the money, plus you keep the strength of that
particular weapon. The same holds true for the armor.  Another
thing is how to get two billion gold as often as you want. Of
course, Iago will only visit you once per day... but you can
arrange it so that you can make him come at anytime. =)  All you
need to do is change your name, either in the IGM, or with the
bartender - it doesn't matter. Upon re-entering the IGM, it will
think it is your first time in, so it will give you all the
random events again. Of course, then you can get the two billion
gold as many times as you wish.  NOTE:  If you win the negative two
billion bet with Iago, you don't go into negative, but rather, you
get two hundred million and something gold. So it's still enough
to buy a Blood Sword and a Golden Armor...which would do just fine,
unless you're REALLY greedy.

**SEE EXPLANATION OF NEGATIVE GOLD at end of file**
Of course, when you change your name in Aladdin's Palace, you can
also train again, so you can gain additional skill points for Thieving,
Mystics and Death Knight. Also, with this, you can go OVER the regular
40 maximum skill points that LORD allows. For example, I believe I
have 55 Mystic use points, and 46 Thieving skill points. The formula
for that is simply the number of points divided by five, so I start
the day off with 9 Thieving uses.  As the number of skill points
increase, the uses do also.  Lastly, you can change your name inside
Aladdin's Palace to just color codes, i.e., '1'4'!'$, which will make
attacking you by others IMPOSSIBLE.  They will have absolutely no way
of bringing your name up in the prompt.
*********************************************************
I can only assume at this writing, that he is speaking of 1.25.
Careful when you attempt any of the cheats for Aladdin's, its many
repair's has caused it to become a time bomb, almost everything you
do and can do, depends on what version you have available to you.
*********************************************************
**::NEW INFORMATION Supplied by Mike Neale::**
Every time you go into Aladdin's palace, try selling a fairy, even
if you don't have one. It will buy your fairy every time you enter,
even if it's more than once a day!  Another thing that I learned from
an earlier version regards buying and selling a weapon.  Buy a Wan's
Weapon from the regular shop and sell it in Aladdin's Palace.  Then go
back to the regular shop and do it all over again.  As many times as
you want.  What happens is, you buy the weapon for 1m and it 'says'
it offers you 500k when you sell it.  It actually  gives you 5m!
PLUS keep an eye on your strength column!  Every time you buy and
sell the Wan's Weapon, your strength keeps going up accordingly.

A FEW WORDS FROM DEVON BROOKS, AUTHOR OF ALADDIN'S PALACE:
  *** All of these bugs mentioned are in =previous=  ***
  *** versions  of Aladdin's Palace.  FREQ "ALADDIN" ***
  *** from 1:140/129, to *** receive Version 2.00 -  ***
  *** which fixes all of these bugs, and much more   ***

`2**CITY OF EROS**
`%submitted by Noriko

The current, yes CURRENT version of City of Eros!   Go in 
and go to Jasmine's Spa (I think it's called).  Make sure 
you have a little money.  Keep pressing Massage or the more 
expensive sauna a million times -- you get experience points 
in 25 increments and 50 increments in the latter.  Okay, you 
don't have to press it a million times, but the more you press 
the more experience you get and you can return to the IGM as 
many times as you like.  Now when you exit, look at your stats 
and see a negative amount -- of course you've exceeded your 
cash on hand in the Spa, but who cares!  Exit the game for a 
sec and when you reenter, bingo!  You've got 2,000,000,000 
gold in hand!  If you have patience, keep going back to the 
Spa!   

`2**FAIRY TOWN**
`%SPECIAL FEATURE
submitted by Loyd Bulmur

The way to get past all three Giants is:

    Prior to entering the IGM, have at least one gem in your
possession.  Try to have over-scale hit points (either through
an IGM or JENNIE-HOTT).

    The following sequence  -* must *-  be followed.

    {T}alk to the Fairy
    {F}ollow the Giant's Footsteps: defeat # 1
    {F}ollow the Giant's Footsteps a second time: defeat # 2
    {O}ffer the Fairy a gem.  No matter how many potions you
receive, drink only the {Y}ellow one.  Your hit points, which
will have been depleted through defeating the first two Giants,
will be restored.
    {F}ollow the Giant's Footsteps for the third time.  Upon
defeating it, you will receive the bonus, which is an appearance
by the Trojan Warrior (for femmes) or the Amazon Warrior (for
males).  The bonus is a random thing, which usually includes
some gems, some gold, and a goodly number of experience points.


`2**JEWELER'S SHOPPE,THE**
`%submitted by Nicole Willson

Go into the Skills Training Center in the Jeweler's Shoppe. 
(I took the Mystical Skills training I'm not sure how this
would work for the other two types of training.) You have to 
pay 1000 gp for each turn, so you should make sure that
you only have about 1000 or 2000 gp in hand. The training
for Mystical Skills is a number-guessing game. The first
time, I guessed right and got about 30 gems. The second
time, I guessed wrong, and ended up with negative gold in
hand.  Quit the game entirely and when you re-enter you'll
have 2 billion gold in hand.

`2**JUANCHO'S PARADISE**
`%submitted by Ann Labuda
 
When you enter Juancho's Paradise, go to the Forest and use 
all thirty of your fights.  You NEVER lose a fight and each 
time you get x amount of strength and x amount of gems (x being a 
number between 1 and 99).  After using up all of your forest fights 
there (you're given 30), leave the forest and talk to the man in the 
corner.  He'll give you a riddle with the answer scrambled, and the 
letters contained in the answer will be given to you.  EX:  Snap!  
Better when wet!  OLTEW  ANS: TOWEL (Note:  They're all that easy)  
He'll let you guess five riddles then tell you that you can't play 
any more today.  Then, go to the Church and Pray to Juancho the Taco 
God (or God of Tacos, I forget exactly how it's worded).  Each time 
you pray to Juancho, you'll get x amount of strength, defense, gems, 
or charm.  (Here, x is a number between 0 and 99)  There is NO LIMIT 
to how many times you can pray to him per day other than how much 
time your SysOp has allotted you to be on his/her board.  If you exit 
Juancho's Paradise at any point and go back in, you'll have 30 more 
forest fights in there, and 5 more riddles to answer, plus of course 
the unlimited prayers.

`2**JOURNEY TO THE CASTLE OF L.O.R.D.**

`%In version 2.00 dated 8/24/95 You can sell negative gems.  
Sell -32000 gems, and you will be given 32000 of them.  
You can then take  them back to the regular LORD and 
trade them to the bartender for strength, defense, and 
hit points.  THIS HAS BEEN REPAIRED in version 2.10:

`2**LORD HUNTER**

`2**LORD'S PIT, THE** v2.50

`%If you exit and re-enter it, your Arena Fights go back up 
to 25.

`2**LORD'S REALM**

`%The original version WW-LRO11.ZIP version 11
Enter the store and ask to buy anything.  When it asks 
how much you want say 100,000.  It will say that it will 
charge you -$xxxxxxx (A lot of cash).  Agree and you will 
come out of the store with TONS of cash.  For example if you 
had 800 strength and you bought 100,000 strength you would 
end up with -30,000 strength and about 100 mil.  To make 
it go positive buy another 100,000.  You will end up with 
2500 strength.  But be careful though, because you can start
 to go into negative cash.  If that happens just buy or sell 
100,000 forest fights until positive again.  This trick 
basically gives you anything you want!  You can get HUGE 
amounts of charm, and using the change sex option, you 
can marry both Seth Able and Violet.  Lord's Realm v0.12 
105 KB is listed, but I do not know if it repairs any of
 the above.

`2**LOVE SHACK, THE**

`%LOVE110.ZIP Version 1.10, LOVE120.ZIP  Version 1.20
Go in Love Shack, and go to the Lounge or Bar.  Order the 
most expensive drink. It SHOULD say that a thief comes 
and knocks you out, and steals all your money.  You 
now  exit the IGM, then exit the game.  The next time you 
enter LORD, you will have 2 billion gold on hand.  IF 
you go into the bank before you exit the game, you will
cancel your negative gold in hand, and be given $100. gold.

`2**MAIL CODES**
`%
'S - for skills
'k - for kids
'{  - for lays
'} - for charm
The above all that work for normal play.  You must have access to 
any IGM that allows the name change of your weapon.  Write in 
'Ssword name, NOTHING else!!  Then every time you check your stats, 
your skills will go up, or what ever of the four you have selected.

`2**MIRROR OF ILLUSION**

`%In the original version, MOI18.ZIP version 18, IF the game
is registered, then press "c" when the first "{MORE} prompt 
pops up.  Enter noisullI fO rorriM" (Mirror Of Illusion 
backwards) and pick the 2429 Town. You will be able 
to bet on fights.  Place a bet of "-2000000000" gold and 
hope you will lose the fight.  If not, you will still 
get over 200 million gold...but not the 2 billion.
If you are satisfied, then leave...if not, stay and

Sandtiger's Bar v2.00 65 KB (Unofficial)  (and I'm sure 
there is 1 or 2 more) There are several different versions 
of this IGM, don't just automatically sell everything and 
jump in there thinking you are going to make billions 
in minutes.  
ORIGINAL VERSION:  You can sell your armor and weapon in 
the LORD game and go into Sandtiger's and sell your "fists" 
and "nothing" for around 2.4 million each.  Then you go 
back to the LORD game weapon and armor shop, sell the 
Sandtiger's weapon and armor, go back and do it again.  
It's very easy to make big money in this version.  
SECOND VERSION:  Start this when you are LEVEL 1 and 
ready to sell your armor. Remember, check it out first, 
because of the different versions.  Have only $1500 gold, 
"fist" for weapon, (this one doesn't work on armor.) Go to 
the shop and sell your weapon, IF the salesman doesn't ask 
you if you want to sell your "fist"  for a quoted amount,
then purchase it 19 more times, (that's 20 all together)  
Napalm does it for 40.  Then exit the IGM, go into the bank, 
do nothing, exit the bank then return. You should have 
200,000,000. gold in the bank now.  IF you have a negative 
amount in hand and nothing in the bank, exit the IGM and 
then go back in, that will give you 2,000,000,000. gold.
Be sure that when you start this you only have $1500. in 
the bank do not have any more or any less or it will not 
work.   With the gold you make from these two versions, 
you can purchase your stats, and skills and charm for 
very little gold.
THIRD VERSION:  This one has to be started at level 1, 
it will not give you big gold, but it will give you level 12
 stats by the time you are at Level 7.  Sell armor and weapon,
go to Sandtiger's IGM and purchase "Sling Shot" and "Lead Pan".  
The purchase price is $500. go to LORD weapon and armor shop 
and sell each for $1500.  With this version, you make a profit
and your stats go up each time you purchase, and they do not 
drop when you sell.  Stick with the first and second weapons 
and armors, otherwise you'll be spending more than your making.
FOURTH VERSION: At level one, when you are ready to sell your 
armor, sell it in the LORD game, then go to Sandtiger's, armor 
dealer, and see if he will buy your "nothing" for a tidy sum. 
If so, have at least enough gold to purchase a "Sling Shot" 
based on what amount the old woman's exchange of 'bar coin's 
to gold coins' is.  Sell your "nothing" to the armor dealer 
and go purchase a Sling Shot.  Leave the IGM, go to the LORD 
weapon's dealer sell the Sling Shot.  Return to Sandtiger's
armor dealer, sell your "nothing" purchase a Sling shot again, 
go back to the LORD weapon's dealer again, sell the sling shot 
again...etc...etc.  Got it?  Your strength keeps going up and 
not dropping, plus you keep selling "nothing" for all that gold.

the negative numbers.

`2**THOR'S BACK ALLEY BAR** BA401.ZIP

`%(Napalm Runner's Version)
Go to any of the little area's in there.  When asked 
for your percentage of ingredients, type in any numbers 
that end up with a value of 100.  For example, you would 
type in -32000 for the first one, and 32100 for the second 
one, and 0 for the rest.  More then likely, you will be 
offered to buy it at a negative amount, and if you pick 
the right percentages, you will also get the special 
attribute also, like the strength, defense, hit points, 
experience, and/or charm.  This works great in the 
"Bathroom", because after you've exhausted your number
of buys, return to the previous menu then go back in, 
and start buying again.
KITERIA'S VERSION:  Go into the bathroom, select 99 
of Purple Pedals, and 0 to the rest, it will say it 
cost a negative amount, say yes and you will GET that 
money plus what you are purchasing.  This works with
every one of the "Bathroom" item's except Goober Grass.  
Every forth time, you must leave the bathroom, but you 
can go right back in.  
THIS HAS BEEN REPAIRED: BA506.ZIP v5.06 Please do

Go into Thor's BackAlley Bar (take at least $100000 with you), 
and (F)ind A Stud.  After you buy one, you should be left with 
a negative amount of gold on hand (it's happened to me every time 
at least).  Exit the IGM, and Quit LORD w/out going to the bank.  
Re-enter the game, and you'll have $2 billion gold on hand.  Oh, 
as far as I know, you have to be a female to do this, so if there is 
another IGM that allows you to change your sex, or for someone to 
change it for you, do that first.

SPECIAL FUNCTION:  Go to the Dark Cloaked Figure and
type "dick", no quote marks.  You will receive 100 charm.
IF you have OVER 100 charm, you will be reduced to 100 charm,
so don't do it if you don't need it.

`2**TURGON'S HOUSE**THOUSE25.ZIP 

`%When you are given the option of either trading in 
your weapon or armor for another one, do not trade 
up for a better weapon/armor.  If you do it will 
only make you weaker.  You are given the weapon/armor, 
but not the strength and defense associated with it.  
Trade in for a weaker weapon or armor if possible.  
That way, when you sell your weapon/armor for a better 
one, you will not lose as much strength/defense.  This 
will make more sense once you start doing it.  You can 
rack up tons of strength and defense this way.
There is a newer version, Turgon's House v2.80 I 
cannot say that it repairs this or not. 

SPECIAL FEATURE
submitted by Mary Jane Frank

I found out that when you are in Turgon's House you can break 
into his room if you are a thief (otherwise you get the message 
"You need a key"). Also, if you open the closet and the fairies 
come out, you try to grab one and it says "You will be humiliated 
for life" your sex changes!  This can really screw up your love 
life! ;)


`2**UNDERGROUND, THE**
`% UNDERV1.ZIP version 1.01 and Underground v1.20

Enter with at least 1 gold.  Go to the gambling area, 
and wager a negative amount of gold.  Depending on what 
level you are on, is important as to how much you should 
wager.  When asked to pick a number between 1 and ten, 
pick "11".  You'll lose.  Continue for the rest of your 
turns.  With the money you just earned, enter the Wizard's 
area.  CAUTION: If you are at a low level, and you bet a
very high amount, you should go and deposit the gold in 
the LORD bank, and other banks as well if available.  If 
you don't, when you enter the Wizard's area, it will 
immediately throw you into the negative, forcing all your 
purchases to be NEGATIVE.  This is not good.  This IGM is 
so choked with easy cheating, that you can cheat yourself if
you're not careful!!!!  While here, you may also make your 
name blink or invisible.  Pick for a name change, enter a 
"'b" before your name to make it blink red or "'y" for 
yellow or simply a color code to make it invisible but 
you will not be able to receive mail unless you write
it first.

`2**VILLAGE OF THE PHOENIX**
`%VOTP-10D.ZIP VOTP-14.ZIP

On older versions, there's a way to get an instant 
2 billion gold. Go to the innkeeper and give him a 
tip of (negative) -2000000000" or so.  This cheat 
is 'high' or 'low' spirit reactive.  
THIS HAS BEEN REPAIRED in version v1.50a  Please do 
this author the courtesy of using only the most recent
release of his work.  NOTE OF WARNING, Guido will kick
your butt if you cheat in the new version and take 
everything you have.

`2**WARRIOR'S GRAVEYARD**  v1.10 

`%This really isn't that big of a deal...but if it's the 
only IGM in the realm, it's still an advantage.  If you 
buy your lemonade, you will notice that you can't buy 
it again...but if you leave and come back, it will let 
you!  If it says "You feel vigorous, I wonder what that 
means?", It means that you may flirt again, with Violet, 
Seth, or the grave digger but not another player.  You can 
also completely change your name and re-enter as a new 
player and go through the entire IGM again.

`2**WEAPON'S OF WAR** v2.53b

`%Before killing the dragon stash everything into this 
IGM, it will all be there waiting for you when you restart.  
You can get tons of gems in this IGM as well.  Go to the 
bank, and pick the option to sell your gems.  You have to 
have at least 1 gem on hand to make this work.  ...i.e.,
you can sell -32000 gems...and get 32,000 gems...of course, 
your money on hand will go into the negatives, but that 
can easily be fixed by either going into the LORD bank and 
leaving without making any transaction, or exiting
the game, and then coming back in.

`2**NEGATIVE GOLD**
`%Contributed by Stanley Chiu

If you go into negative gold in some way, DO NOT go in 
and out of the bank. The 100 gold compensation is a pretty 
shoddy one.  What you SHOULD do is THIS:  When you see you 
have negative gold, leave LORD.  Upon re-entry, you'll see 
that you have two billion gold on hand. The reason is 
pretty simple...; LORD naturally assumes you obtained 
negative gold because you went OVER the 2,147,483,617 limit,
so it gives you two billion back, because it doesn't want to 
"cheat" you.

`2***WORDS OF WISDOM FROM THE "GREAT" NAPALM RUNNER***

`%If you exceed the limited amount of gold, or experience 
which is right around 2.147 billion, it will revert you back
to 2 billion gold, and the same amount of experience.  Experience
is not that big a deal.  Your hit points, strength, and defense 
will go into the negative if you exceed 32,767.  When this 
happens to your strength or defense or in some occasions both, 
sell the equipment, and it will drop you down.  If it is hit points 
that has gone over the 32,767 limit, purchase gems and redeem them 
at the bartenders.  Instead of going up, it will go down and take 
you out of the negative.
