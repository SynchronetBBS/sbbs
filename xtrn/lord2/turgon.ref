  `2Turgon reads the diary quietly.  He looks sad.

  `0"I knew Barak to be juvenile - but I never dreamed he felt this way.  We
  must go to the city council and show them."

`k  `2You agree to go with Turgon.  A short while later you pass through
  the Greentree gates.  Turgon dabs his eyes quickly.

`k  `2People eye him as you pass - the guards do not stop him - many
  probably trained under him.  A crowd begins to form behind you.

`k  The walk ends in front of the city council.  Turgon goes in and comes
  out a few minutes later with the town elders.

  `0"Turgon is innocent!  Turgon is innocent!" `2a young child screams
  excitedly.  Other voices join his cry - by the time the group reaches
  the training center there are hundreds.

`k  Turgon stands erect - for the first time since you met him you now
  understand what being a `0level 12`2 master is all about.  He demands that
  Barak see him.

`k  `2You see Barak's face look out a window.  When his eyes fall upon the
  small book you are clutching he screams.  `0"`n`0!  Why have you
  done this to me?!  You have ruined me!"

  `$"You ruined yourself.  Don't forget this." `2you reply stonily.

`k  `%YOU RECIEVE 30 QUEST POINTS.

  `2You give the diary back to the sobbing Barak.
