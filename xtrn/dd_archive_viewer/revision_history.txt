Revision History for Digital Distortion Archive Viewer
======================================================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.04     2022-05-14   Now makes use of Synchronet's built-in archiver to
                      extract archives, if possible. If that fails, it will
                      then try to extract with a configured extraction command,
                      if available.
1.03     2009-12-20   Updated DDArcViewer.js to be able to handle command-line
                      parameters with spaces in them as single parameters,
                      thanks to a function posted by Tracker1 of The Roughnecks
                      BBS.
1.02     2009-12-18   Updated to be able to handle file names/directory names
                      with spaces in them.  This involves using a Baja script
                      to write the filename to a temporary file, which is read
                      by the JavaScript script.
1.01     2009-12-16   Minor update to the documentation.
1.00     2009-09-10   First general public release
0.99     2009-09-02   Beta test, pre-general release verison.
