@CENTER@nyhe4 Synchronet Minesweeper Help n

@CENTER@The classic game, recreated for this Synchronet BBS!
@CENTER@http://www.minesweeper.info/

@CENTER@hYou're in a mine field!n

The object of the game is to uncover all the safe areas (blocks) in the mine
field without uncovering (detonating) any mines (rhën), within the allowed time!
It's a game of quick deduction, pattern-recognition, and a little bit o' luck!

hControlsn:

ù hcMoven the block selector h[i_nh]n around the game board using the arrow keys,
  home/end/page-up/down or the numeric keypad (i.e. for diagonal movement).
  
ù hcDign a block (reveal its contents) using the 'hDn' key or the hspace-barn.
  If you dig-up/detonate a mine (rhi*n), sorry, game over: you lose, try again!
  
  The first block you uncover is guaranteed to be empty (safe).
  If you reveal an empty block, then all adjacent empty blocks will also be
  uncovered (a depth-first search algorithm popular in coding interviews)!
  Uncovered safe blocks with a mine in any surrounding/adjacent blocks will
  have the total number of adjacent mines displayed (a digit, from c1n to c8n).
  These digits are your clue where the next mine or empty block may be located.
  When all empty blocks are uncovered, the game is won!

ù hcFlagn a covered block as having a suspected mine with the 'hFn' key.
  You can also remove a flag ('rhŸn') or change it to an uncertainty indicator
  ('rh?n') with the 'F' key (it's a 3-way toggle).
  If you lose, incorrectly-flagged safe blocks are indicated with a 'rh!n'.
  
@CENTER@hChordingn  
  Once you have flagged one or more blocks as likely containing a mine, you may
  have the option of automatically uncovering all blocks surrounding a
  previously uncovered block if the number of surrounding mines matches the
  number of flagged blocks. This time-saving operation is called a cChordn and is
  invoked with the 'hCn' key, when appropriate. Note: if you have an incorrectly
  placed flag ('rhŸn') in the area, a Chord operation will detonate a mine!

ù hcDisplayn a list of top-ranked previous game-winners with the 'hWn' key.
  You can view a log of all clocaln wins and losses with the 'hLn' key.

ù hcStartn a new game with the the 'hNn' key. A new difficulty level may be chosen.
  Larger user terminals can support larger game boards for greater challenges!

ù hcQuitn the game with the 'hQn' key.

ù hcRedrawn the game board with the hCtrl-Rn key combination.

ù hcTogglen the affected-area highlight feature with the hTABn key.
  Cycle through the available block-selector styles using hCtrl-Sn.
  
ù Toggle hcgraphics moden (when supported) with the hCtrl-Gn key.

hDifficulty Leveln:

The difficulty level may be chosen when a new game is started (level 1 being
the lowest / easiest). The density of mines is increased with each level and
the game board is increased in dimensions, if possible (depending on terminal
size, in columns and rows).
          
cLevel  Target Grid  Mines  Densityn
  h1      10 x 10      10     10%  n
  h2      15 x 15      28     12%  n
  h3      20 x 20      60     15%  n
  h4      25 x 25     109     17%  n
  h5      30 x 30     180     20%  n

If the target grid height cannot be achieved, a wider game board will be
generated / used.  If the total target grid size (in blocks) cannot be
generated, fewer mines will be deployed to maintain the indicated mine density
(percentage) and the calculated difficulty level will be discounted
accordingly.

hAdditional Movement Optionsn:

If some of the navigation keys (e.g. arrow keys, home, end) do not work for
your terminal, you can try using these alternatives:

  ù Up Arrow: Ctrl-^
  ù Down Arrow: Ctrl-J
  ù Left Arrow: Ctrl-]
  ù Right Arrow: Ctrl-F
  ù Home: Ctrl-B
  ù End: Ctrl-E
  ù Page-Up: Ctrl-P
  ù Page-Down: Ctrl-N
  
... or use the numeric keypad.

Good luck!
