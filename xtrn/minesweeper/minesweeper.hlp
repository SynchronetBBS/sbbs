nyhe4 Synchronet Minesweeper Help n

The classic game, revisited for this Synchronet BBS!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)

The object of the game is to uncover all the safe areas (cells) on the game
board without uncovering (detonating) any mines (rhën), within the allowed time!

hControlsn:

ù cMoven the cell selector h<i_nh>n around the game board using the arrow keys,
  home/end/page-up/down or the numeric keypad (i.e. for diagonal movement).
  
ù cUncovern a cell (reveal its contents) using the 'hRn' key or the hspace-barn.
  If you reveal/detonate a mine (rhi*n), sorry, game over: you lose, try again!
  The first cell you uncover is guaranteed to be empty (safe).
  If you reveal an empty cell, then all adjacent empty cells will also be
  uncovered (a depth-first search algorithm popular in coding interviews)!
  Uncovered safe cells with a mine in any surrounding/adjacent cells will have
  the total number of adjacent mines displayed (a digit, from 1 to 8).
  These digits are your clue where the next mine or empty cell may be located.
  When all empty cells are uncovered, the game is won!

ù cFlagn a covered cell as having a suspected mine with the 'hFn' key.
  You can also remove a flag with the 'F' key (it's a toggle).
  If the game is lost, incorrectly-flagged safe cells are indicated with a 'rh!n'.

ù cDisplayn a list of previous game-winners with the 'hWn' key.

ù cStartn a new game with the the 'hNn' key. A new difficulty level may be chosen.
  Larger user terminals can support larger game boards for greater challenges!

ù cQuitn the game with the 'hQn' key.

ù cRedrawn the game board with the hCtrl-Rn key combination.

If some of the navigation keys (e.g. arrow keys, home, end) do not work for
your terminal, you can try using these alternatives:
  ù Up Arrow: Ctrl-^
  ù Down Arrow: Ctrl-J
  ù Left Arrow: Ctrl-]
  ù Right Arrow: Ctrl-F
  ù Home: Ctrl-B
  ù End: Ctrl-E
  ù Page-Up: Ctrl-P
  ù Page-Down: Ctrl-N
  
... or use the numeric keypad.

hDifficulty Leveln:

The difficulty level may be chosen when a new game is started (level 1 being
the lowest / easiest). The density of mines is increased with each level and
the game board is increased in dimensions, if possible (depending on terminal
size, in columns and rows).
          
cLevel  Target Grid  Mines  Densityn
  h1      10 x 10      10     10%  n
  h2      15 x 15      28     12%  n
  h3      20 x 20      60     15%  n
  h4      25 x 25     109     17%  n
  h5      30 x 30     180     20%  n

If the target grid height cannot be achieved, a wider game board will be
generated / used.  If the total target grid size (in cells) cannot be
generated, fewer mines will be deployed to maintain the indicated mine density
(percentage) and the calculated difficulty level will be discounted
accordingly.
