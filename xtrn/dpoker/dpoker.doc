    Domain Poker is a single/multi-player, real-time, 5 card draw poker game.
The game can have up to 6 players per table, and up to 25 tables.  Each table
has a configurable bet limit, ante, and table limit.  Tables can be password
protected for private games, and the "house" can take a configurable percentage
of the pot from games.

    Single player games are played against the computer.  The computer can be
turned off completely, or allowed to play only on certain tables (at your
option).  You also have the option to not allow the computer to be on password
protected tables (to keep users from hogging the tables for themselves).

    Messages can be sent from within Domain Poker to your Synchronet BBS (and
vice-versa) as well as to other Synchronet online games which support this
option.

    This booklet will show you how to set up Domain Poker for your Synchronet
BBS, as well as give you helpful hints on how to set up the computer player
and other options which are available to you.  Most of your questions should be
answered in here, so be sure to read this booklet thoroughly.

    Enjoy, and be sure to check out the other fine programs available from
Domain Entertainment!

        Synchronet specific games and to the BBS as well.

    o   Desqview/Windows/OS/2 aware, automatically gives up time when the

    o   The computer player may be limited to certain tables, or disabled
        completely if desired.

    o   BBS's can elect to take a percentage of the pot from games (rather
        than charging a set amount of credits to play the game).

    o   Automatically performs daily maintenance.

    The game setup is very simple.  Just run the program INSTALL.EXE, and it'll
create the necessary directories and copy the files for you!  After that's done
read on!
    NOTE: If you received Domain Poker in compressed form with no INSTALL.EXE
program, you will need to create a directory off of your Synchronet XTRN
directory, call the directory DPOKER (\SBBS\XTRN\DPOKER), and unzip the archive
into this sub-directory.
    Now, set up the game (using the Synchronet configuration program) so that
it looks like this (NOTE: This is the setup screen for Synchronet v3.13 and is
different from older 16-bit DOS versions of Domain Poker!).

    You're just about ready to go now, the only thing left to do is to set up
the Domain Poker options and tables to suit your system.  To do this, go to
your Domain Poker directory and run DPCONFIG.
    Once you're in the DPCONFIG program, highlight the first option (Configur
Domain Poker Settings) and press ENTER.
    Now go through the list and modify each of the options to your liking.

    The first option, Computer Player Name, is the name that the computer will
use in computer vs. player games.  If this option is left blank, it will
default to the system guru name.
    Next, is the time allowed against the computer, this is the amount of time
each day that a user will be allowed to play against the computer.  After this
amount of time has been exceeded, the computer player "leaves the table" until
the next day.
    Percentage house takes from pot is exactly that, this is the amount (in
percent) that the house (your BBS) will skim from the pot in poker games (both
single and multi-player games).

    When you are done setting these options to your liking, hit ESC.  Once you
are back at the main selection menu, select the second option (Edit Domain
Poker Tables) and press ENTER.

    Now, from here you can add (by hitting INS), remove (by hitting DEL) or
edit (by hitting ENTER) the options and bet limits for each poker table.
To edit the options of a particular table, move the select bar over the table
you wish to edit and press ENTER, if there are no tables, press INS first to
add one.

    Now go through the options for this table and modify each of the options
to your liking.

    The first option here, Computer Player on This Table, determines whether
or not users entering this table will encounter a computer player.  If set
to NO, the user will have to wait for another user to join that table,
otherwise the computer will be waiting to play.
    The next option, Allow Password Protection, determines whether or not a
user entering this table will be able to place a password lock on the table.
    The next three options determine the table, ante, and bet limits of this
table (in K of credits), set these to your liking, but for best results read
the page on Optimizing Your Setup in this document.

    Now you'll need to configure the other tables to your liking, and you're
set to go!

    If you include the /L option at the end of the Domain Poker command line,
daily computer wins and losses will be logged to a file (with the format of
MM/DD/YY.LOG) each day.  The number stored in this log is either positive
(indicating that the computer won that day) or negative (indicating that the
computer lost).  The number also reflects any credits which may have been
skimmed by the house in the games.  You may wish to periodically delete these
logs, or you may disable the logging by omitting the /L from the command line.

    First, it's important to know that the computer player makes all of his
bets on a percentage basis, so although he is a very competetive player, it is
not practicial to allow him to play on very high limit tables because of the
way he bets.  I've found that the optimum table set up for the computer is a
250k bet limit, 1000k table limit, and a 250k ante.  Personally, I wouldn't
place the computer on a table higher than 500k bet limit, 2500k table limit,
and 500k ante.  Tables with lower limits will pose no threat to the computers
abilities.

    Also, it is important that you not set the ante of your table too low, I
would keep the ante and bet limit both at about 20% of the table limit.  When
you set your ante lower than that, it makes it very easy for players to fold on
a bad hand and continue folding until a good hand comes along (which makes the
game unexciting and uneventful).

    When setting up your tables in the config file, it's best to set your
tables up in ascending order of limits.  This makes it easy for users to choose
a low or high roller table, as well as makes it possible to limit the computer
player to the lower tables if you so desire (in my personal configuration I
have 9 tables ranging from 500k to 5000k table limits, the computer is only
allowed on the first 5 (1000k table limits and lower)).

    Also, I would not suggest setting line 6 to an amount greater than 10%.  I
find that users don't seem to miss giving up that percentage in turn for
playing other users and taking their credits, but setting this amount too high
may discourage users from playing at all!

    Well, that's about it for suggestions.  Follow these basic guidelines and
you shouldn't run across any problems.  You may find that certain things work
out better for you and your system, so use what you find to suit you best!

    Once again, thank you for using Domain Poker, and be sure to watch for
other items from Domain Entertainment.
