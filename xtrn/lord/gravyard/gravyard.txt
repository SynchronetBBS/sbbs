-> What the Heck is This!???

  Well hmmm... Good question <G>. The Warrior's Graveyard is an IGM  for the 
popular door game Legend Of The Red Dragon by Seth Able Robinson. This is an 
add-on Graveyard. Players can grave rob, find all hidden ghosts, or cool off 
with a nice glass of enchanted Lemon-Aide!

-> Q and A

 Q: Where are all the Ghosts Hidden?

 A: Well if I told you that, it wouldn't be a secret any more!
    ...but I'll give you a few hints.
      Jim Bob Jones is a random sorta guy.
      George likes the Graves for some reason.
      Tanya, well you can only see her if you're male.
      Mike, he won't talk to guys...so female is the way to go
    I hope these hints help...but don't ruin the IGM.

 Q: Why so few Qs?
 
 A: Well this is new... no Qs mean no As!
