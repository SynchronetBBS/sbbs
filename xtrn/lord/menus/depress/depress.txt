            This is just a simple file I created for the heck of it to just
test my imagination abilitys and extent...newer menus will be out with other
story lines involved but I was in this kinda mood so..i decided to go ahead
and do it!!! So...I'm not going to do any sorta registration crap since I
dont' need money..2- what kind of cripples have I put in???? that's the big
one..there is no need..this is Freeware! please feel free to distrbuit this to
any other BBS at will....There are way to many people to try and thank for
being there by my side in my battle of depression...so..If i could make a
list i would but I know I would forget a name or 5 or maybe 7...but...thank you
all for being by my side and beliving in me...so...Just copy the lordtxt.dat
file into the lord directory and see what i have created! thank you all!
             BUT! One person who must not let his name not be forgetten in all
his fame is yet mentioned again! Thank you Seth Able for such a great game...
Thanks Seth!!!! TDT Inc. is glad to be able to release this menu set..
