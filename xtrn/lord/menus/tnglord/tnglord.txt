                  From the maker of Star Wars LORD:
                    Star Trek: The Next Generation

        From Bob Bovaird, ST: TNG LORD!!!  All new menu sets, text
   files, and monsters.  Just copy all the files over the old ones in
   your LORD directory.  Though you might want to backup the old ones.
   I made this file purely out of fun.  I expect no money for it, just
   praise (please!!!!) and thanks.  I already have Star Wars LORD,
   and coming soon is Star Trek: The Original Series LORD.  I also
   have gotten requests for Batman, and Lord of the Rings.  I actually
   enjoy making these, so please, feel free to call my BBS and leave
   requests.  Thanks.
