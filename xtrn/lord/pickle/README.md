Other Places Pickles is an IGM for Lord 5.00 JS by 
The Lizard Master

See LORD 5.00 JS Sysop.doc for installing this and other IGMs

In this IGM you find the Pickle Goddess and her magic pickle
garden.  The magic pickles are stronger the higher you select
from the patch.  You gain or lose a percentage of what you 
have from a randomly selected trait.  The trick to this is
you can keep eating stronger pickles, but the deck is stacked
in a Las Vegas slot machine way.  On a long enough time line,
the house will win so as not to upset the balance of the game.
