# The Outhouse - An IGM for JSLord

## From outhouse.txt

-> What the Heck is This!???

  This is a quick daily IGM for JSLord. Pop over to the Outhouse and do your
business! Trade 1 Forest Fight for the chance at a stat boost, or take your 
chances and find a spot in the wild. This was designed to be a quick daily 
play, though there is a lot of text to read through :)

  This IGM was originally created by Robert Fogt in the 90s, but I was 
passed the source to fix the BP200 errors. I figured that this would be a fun 
addition to any JSLord game, so here we are!
