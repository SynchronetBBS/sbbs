-> What the Heck is This!???

  This is a quick daily IGM for JSLord. Pop over to the Outhouse and do your
business! Trade 1 Forest Fight for the chance at a stat boost, or take your 
chances and find a spot in the wild. This was designed to be a quick daily 
play, though there is a lot of text to read through :)

  This IGM was originally created by Robert Fogt in the 90s, but I was 
passed the source to fix the BP200 errors. I figured that this would be a fun 
addition to any JSLord game, so here we are!


-> Simple Set-Up

   Installing The Outhouse couldn't be any easier! Just run the following:

	jsexec lord.js +IGM outhouse/outhouse.js


-> Simple Un-Installation

   Un-installing The Outhouse is just as easy. Run the following:

	jsexec lord.js -IGM outhouse/outhouse.js


-> Q and A

 Q: What does this IGM add to Lord?

 A: Basically you can trade 1 Forest Fight for a chance at Charm, Defense or 
    Strength. There is a chance at finding some extra loot as well. If you 
	choose not to spend the Forest Fight you can gain or lose charm. 
	
	Hopefully this won't break any meta, but please let me know!

 Q: Why so few Qs?
 
 A: Well this is new... no Qs mean no As!
