NOTE:	The command line contains an OPTIONAL argument 'INTERBBS'
		specifying whether the game is to operate in local
		or inter-BBS mode. To operate local only, remove the 
		argument from the command line, otherwise it will attempt
		to use the inter-BBS service, as described in INTERBBS.DOC.
		
NOTE:	It is recommended that you check frequently for updates 
		from the Synchronet CVS repository located at:
		
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xtrn/uberblox/

	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/exec/load/
