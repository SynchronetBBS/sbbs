				answer:3,
				answers:[
				"It narrows the bandwidth of the received signal to improve signal to noise ratio",
					"It compensates for the effects of an isotropic antenna, thereby improving directivity",
					"It reduces loss of received signals caused by antenna pattern nulls, thereby increasing sensitivity",
					"It prevents receiver overload which could make it difficult to determine peaks or nulls"

				title:"E9H08 (A)",
				question:"What is the function of a sense antenna?",
				answer:0,
				answers:[
				"It modifies the pattern of a DF antenna array to provide a null in one direction ",
					"It increases the sensitivity of a DF antenna array ",
					"It allows DF antennas to receive signals at different vertical angles",
					"It provides diversity reception that cancels multipath signals"

				title:"E9H09 (C)",
				question:"Which of the following describes the construction of a receiving loop antenna?",
				answer:2,
				answers:[
				"A large circularly-polarized antenna  ",
					"A small coil of wire tightly wound around a toroidal ferrite core",
					"One or more turns of wire wound in the shape of a large open coil",
					"A vertical antenna coupled to a feed line through an inductive loop of wire"
				],
			},
			{
				title:"E9H10 (D)",
				question:"How can the output voltage of a multi-turn receiving loop antenna be increased?",
				answer:3,
				answers:[
				"By reducing the permeability of the loop shield",
					"By increasing the number of wire turns in the loop and reducing the area of the loop structure",
					"By winding adjacent turns in opposing directions",
					"By increasing either the number of wire turns in the loop or the area of the loop structure or both"

			{
				title:"E9H11 (B)",
				question:"What characteristic of a cardioid-pattern antenna is useful for direction finding?",
				answer:1,
				answers:[
				"A very sharp peak",
					"A very sharp single null",
					"Broad band response",
					"High-radiation angle"
				],

			{
				title:"E9H12 (B)",
				question:"What is an advantage of using a shielded loop antenna for direction finding?",
				answer:1,
				answers:[
				"It automatically cancels ignition noise pickup in mobile installations",
					"It is electro-statically balanced against ground, giving better nulls",
					"It eliminates tracking errors caused by strong out-of-band signals",
					"It allows stations to communicate without giving away their position"
