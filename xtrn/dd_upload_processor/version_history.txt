Revision History for Digital Distortion Upload Processor
========================================================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.08     2026-02-05   More robust filename extension matching based on what's
                      in ddup_file_types.cfg
1.07     2025-08-11   Supports .example.cfg configuration filenames. Also allows
                      reading the configuration file from sbbs/mods or sbbs/ctrl
1.06     2023-08-08   When a virus scan fails, the scan output is written to the
                      system log (as a warning) rather than to the user's
                      console session.
1.05     2023-08-07   Internal refactor of how the configuration files are
                      read. Behavior is the same.
1.04     2023-08-06   Now uses Synchronet's built-in archiver (added in
                      Synchronet 3.19), if available, to extract archives.
1.03     2022-06-11   Removed the chmod updates because they're actually not
                      needed.  Some antivirus scanners (such as ClamAV) need
                      a command line parameter to pass the file permissions
                      descriptor to the scanner.
1.02     2022-06-11   More chmod updates (similar to 1.01)
1.01     2022-06-08   Updated so that the scanning works properly in Linux
1.00     2009-12-29   First general public release
