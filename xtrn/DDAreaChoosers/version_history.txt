Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.49     2026-02-27   Bug fix: Middle column color bleeding over into the column
                      for # of items for areas with less than 10,000 items.
                      Bug fix: The # items column right-aligns correctly and
                      consistently (including areas with more than 1000 items)
1.48     2025-12-31   The area choosers can now save the user's last chosen
                      sub-board (for each message group) and file directory (for
                      each file library); also, there's a new user setting to
                      toggle whether to use the last-known sub-board/directory.
1.47     2025-10-03   Mouse click hotspots in the key help lines. Some of the
                      click hotspots have an issue that causes the chooser to
                      exit out though - the full sequence for the key for those
                      clicks (ESC + ...) might not be captured.
1.46     2025-08-26   Replaced arrow keys in the key help line since some
                      terminals can't display them.
1.45     2025-06-18   Added support for sorting, with a user configuration
                      option.  User settings can be opened via Ctrl-U.
1.44     2025-06-05   Fix (message area chooser only): Sub-board item colors
                      are properly aligned again
1.43     2025-06-01   *.example.cfg files provided in the Synchronet repo: If
                      DDFileAreaChooser.cfg or DDMsgAreaChooser.cfg don't exist,
                      read the ones with .example.cfg instead. Sysops can copy
                      the .example.cfg files and remove the .example from the
                      name to make configuration changes, and the .cfg files
                      can be in sbbs/mods or xtrn/DDAreaChoosers.
                      Also made an internal refactor, moving some common
                      functionality out into DDAreaChooserCommon.js to make
                      development a bit simpler.
1.42f    2025-05-28   Name collapsing now works at the top level. Also, support
                      for a double separator to not collapse (and display just
                      one of those characters).
1.42e    2025-05-27   Fix: Name collapsing for group names w/ more than 1
                      instance
1.42d    2025-05-03   File area chooser only - Fix: Displays the configured
                      area change header again
1.42c    2025-04-21   F & L keys working again on the light bar menu (first &
                      last page).
                      Message area chooser: Fix for
                      "this.DisplayMenuHdrWithNumItems is not a function".
                      File area choser: Fix to ensure the header lines are
                      written in the proper place after showing help.
1.42b    2025-04-10   Fix: altName wasn't added to items if name collapsing
                      disabled.
                      Also, start of name collapsing enhancement (no empty
                      names).
1.42     2025-03-17   For both: Name collapsing now supports an arbitrary number
                      of areas (depth) with an arbitrary number of separators
1.41     2024-03-13   File area chooser: Fix for the directory item counts
1.41     2023-10-27   Message area chooser only: In lightbar mode, when using
                      name collapisng, ensure the menu item for the appropriate
                      subgroup is selected.
                      The file area chooser was already doing this.
1.40     2023-10-24   Name collapsing: Fix for incorrect subboard/directory
                      assignment.  Also, won't collapse if the name before the
                      separator is the same as the message group description.
1.39     2023-10-17   Message area chooser only: Should now be faster when
                      finding the timestamp of the latest readable message
1.38     2023-10-07   Message area chooser fix for name collapsing mode with the
                      lightbar interface: No longer gets stuck in a loop when
                      choosing a sub-board. The message area chooser version
                      was 1.37 before and has been updated to 1.38, which
                      matches the file area chooser.
1.38     2023-09-17   File area chooser: Bug fix for searching with name
                      collapsing
1.37     2023-09-16   Header line bug fix
1.36     2023-07-21   Message area chooser fix for not allowing to change sub-
                      board if the first group is empty. File area chooser fix:
                      When using directory collapsing mode with the lightbar
                      interface, it now exits when the user chooses their same
                      file directory instead of continuing the menu input loop.
1.35     2023-05-14   File area chooser fix: Displays correct file counts in
                      directories when using directory name collapsing.
                      Both: Internal refactor for the code that reads the
                      configuration file (no functional change).
1.34     2023-04-15   Fix: For lightbar mode with sub-board or dir collapsing,
                      these now set the selected item based on the user's
                      current sub-board or directory. Also, color settings no
                      longer need the control character (they can just be a list
                      of the attribute characters).
1.33     2023-03-19   File area chooser: Fix for inputting the library/dir # in
                      lightbar mode. Updated wording for that as well. Changed
                      the version to match the message area chooser.
                      Messsage area chooser: Updated wording for inputting the
                      library/dir # in lightbar mode
1.32     2022-11-07   Message area chooser only: Bug fix for numeric input when
                      choosing a sub-board.  Bug fix for getting the number of
					  posts with the traditional user interface.
1.31     2022-11-04   Message area chooser only: Made use of the 'posts'
                      property in msg_area.sub[sub-code] (or
                      msg_area.grp_list.sub_list) for the number of posts
                      without votes, if that property exists (it was added
                      in Synchronet 3.18c)
1.30     2022-08-19   Made use of the control key passthru setting so that
                      certain hotkeys (such as Ctrl-P, for Pageup) are only
                      caught by the scripts and not passed thru to the BBS.
1.29     2022-07-23   Re-arranged the help text to be more consistent with
                      each other.
1.28     2022-07-06   File area chooser: Lightbar mode fix for not actually
                      moving to the user's selected directory when directly
                      choosing a directory in their library
1.27     2022-07-03   File area chooser fix: When listing libraries without
                      first listing directories within the user's current
                      library, it wouldn't display the libraries the first
                      time because the library information wasn't built when
                      using directory collapsing.  This has been fixed.
1.26     2022-06-12   File area chooser fix: Running the scipt with the "false"
                      command-line parameter works again, allowing the user to
                      choose the file directory within their file library.
1.26     2022-06-11   Message area chooser only: Updated to try to prevent the
                      error "this.subBoardListPrintfInfo[pGrpIdx] is undefined"
1.25     2022-06-06   Message area chooser only: Fix for miscolored digit(s) in
                      # messages column in the sub-board list when using the
                      lightbar menu
1.24     2022-05-17   Fix for searching & error reporting (probably due to a
                      mistaken copy & paste in a past commit)
1.23     2022-03-18   For message sub-board/file directory collapsing, if there
                      is only one sub-group/sub-library, then it won't be
                      collapsed, as that wouldn't be very useful.
1.22     2022-01-12   In the file area chooser, fixed a lightbar file directory
                      choosing issue when using name collapsing (was using the
                      wrong data structure)
1.21     2022-01-15   Now supports message sub-board & file directory name
                      collapsing, allowing simplified file directory and message
                      sub-board lists for ones with common groups, adding a 3rd
                      tier of options.
1.20     2020-04-19   Now uses the DDLightbarMenu class for lightbar mode, and
                      the internal lightbar code has been removed.  Requires
                      the latest dd_lightbar_menu.js in sbbs/exec/load.
1.19     2019-08-24   Bug fix for the 'next' search feature in lightbar mode
1.18     2019-08-22   Added the ability to search for message/file areas, using
                      either the / key or CTRL_F.  And in lightbar mode, the N
                      key can be used to look for the next match.
1.17     2018-06-25   For the message area chooser, added a new configuration
                      file option, showDatesInSubBoardList, that specifies
                      whether or not to show the date & time of the latest
                      message in the sub-boards.
1.16     2018-03-09   Bug fix for off-by-one issue when there is a file group
                      with no directories or a message group with no
                      sub-boards
1.15     2017-12-18   Updated the definitions of the KEY_PAGE_UP and
                      KEY_PAGE_DOWN variables to match what they are in
                      sbbsdefs.js (if defined) from December 18, 2017 so that
                      the PageUp and PageDown keys continue to work properly.
                      These scripts should still also work with older builds
                      of Synchronet.
1.14     2017-08-30   Bug fix in the message area chooser: A function was not
                      implemented (result of a copy & paste where I didn't
                      include the missing function that was called).
1.13     2016-12-11   Updated the message area chooser to show the number of
                      readable messages rather than the actual total number of
                      messages in the sub-boards (in case some messages are
                      deleted, unverified, etc.)
1.12     2016-11-22   Updated the message area chooser to work better with
                      Synchronet 3.17.  Null message headers seem to be more
                      common with Synchronet 3.17 due to the message voting
                      feature that was introduced in that version.
1.11     2016-02-19   Bug fix: THe page number on the screen wasn't being updated
                      properly when navigating between screens in the message
                      group/file library list.
1.10     2016-02-15   Added the ability to display a custom header file above
                      the area lists in the area choosers.  Added the
                      configuration options areaChooserHdrFilenameBase and
                      areaChooserHdrMaxLines to specify the filename (without
                      the extension) and maximum number of lines from the header
                      file to use.  Also, when showing the message written
                      dates, the dates of all messages will be adjusted to the
                      BBS's local time zone for consistency.
1.09     2016-01-17   Added a command-line parameter to let the user choose a
                      message sub-board only within their current message
                      group, or file directory only within their current file
                      library.
1.08     2015-04-19   Added customizable color settings for the key help text
                      line displayed at the bottom of the screen in lightbar
                      mode.  Also, updated to allow the PageUp and PageDown
                      keys to be used instead of the P and N keys to go to the
                      previous & next pages in lightbar mode.
1.07     2014-12-22   Message area chooser:
                      Bug fix: Made this.colors.subBoardHeader apply to the
                      whole line rather than just the page number.
                      Bug fix: The initial display of the page number is now
                      correct (previously, it would start out saying page 1,
                      even if on another page).
                      Documentation & example configuration files:
                      Added the color options subBoardHeader (for the message
                      area chooser) and fileAreaHdr (for the file area chooser)
                      to the documentation and example configuration files.
1.06     2014-09-14   Bug fix: Updated the lightbar highlight format string to
                      include a normal attribute at the end to avoid the
                      highlight color to be used when clearing the screen,
                      etc.  Bug reported by Psi-Jack.
1.05     2013-05-10   Bug fix in the file area chooser: When listing
                      directories in a file group, it would sometimes
                      crash due to an incorrect array index used, and
                      the array was not set up.  Those have been fixed.
1.04     2013-05-04   Updated to properly format message sub-boards and
                      file directories with more than 9999 entries.  The
                      formatting is now dynamically adjusted depending
                      on the greatest number of entries in a sub-board
                      for a message group or file directory in a file
                      library (the descriptions will shrink as the
                      text length of the greatest number of entries
                      increases).
1.03     2012-11-30   Bug fix: After leaving the help screen from the
                      sub-board/directory list, the top line is now
                      correctly written with the page information as "Page
                      # of #".
1.02     2012-10-06   For the lightbar interface, the current page number is
                      now displayed at the top of the screen (along with the
                      total number of pages) and is updated when going to a
                      new page.
1.01     2011-04-22   Fixed the wording when choosing a message sub-board and
                      file library.
1.00     2010-03-13   First public release
