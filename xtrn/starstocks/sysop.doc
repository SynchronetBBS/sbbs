*****UPDATING YOUR LOCAL LIBRARIES******

NOTE: It is recommended that you check frequently for game updates from the 
Synchronet CVS repository located at:
	
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xtrn/starstocks/
	
Before you attempt to install the program, it is recommended that you
update your relative 'exec/' and 'exec/load/' paths
with the latest files from the Synchronet CVS repository at:
	
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/exec/
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/exec/load/
	

*****CONFIGURING YOUR EXTERNAL PROGRAM*****

Sample configuration in SCFG -> external programs:

	[Star Stocks]
	 1: Name                       Star Stocks
	 2: Internal Code              STARSTOX
	 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/starstocks/
	 4: Command Line               *stars.js
	 5: Clean-up Command Line      
	 6: Execution Cost             None
	 7: Access Requirements        
	 8: Execution Requirements     
	 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
	10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
	11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
	12: Use Shell to Execute       No
	13: Modify User Data           No
	14: Execute on Event           No
	15: Pause After Execution      No
	16: BBS Drop File Type         None
	17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
	18: Time Options...
	
	
*****CONFIGURING THE GAME HOST******

There is a SERVER.INI file included with every inter-BBS JavaScript game.
If you wish to connect your BBS to an existing network, edit the file and 
put the appropriate hostname or IP address, and the port on which the network is 
operating (default: 10088)

	Default SERVER.INI text for local play:
	
		host=localhost
		port=10088


*****SETTING UP THE GAME SERVICE WITH SYNCHRONET*****

NOTE: You only need to do this part if you plan to host the game yourself

If you wish to host your own service for others to connect to or to play locally, you must edit 
the file SERVICES.INI in your relative 'ctrl/' path. You must also open whichever port you 
specify on your router to allow other systems to connect (and edit your local server.ini
files so that you connect to your service).

	Default SERVICES.INI text for the service:
	
		[JSON]
		Port = 10088
		Options = STATIC | LOOP
		Command = json-service.js
		
You must also edit the file JSON-SERVICE.INI in your relative 'ctrl/' path and either 
uncomment the [starstocks] section, or add it yourself. 

	Default JSON-SERVICE.INI text for Star Stocks:
	
		[starstocks]
		dir=../xtrn/starstocks/

The inter-BBS features of this program require that the appropriate services be configured, 
and that all of your files are up to date. The following files are needed to operate 
this program in inter-BBS mode, and can be downloaded from the Synchronet CVS repository at:

	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/

		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/json-service.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-db.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-sock.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-chat.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-client.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ctrl/json-service.ini
	
[EXEC/LOAD/JSON-CHAT.JS]

	This handles all inbound/outbound chat messages, and packages them for delivery json client.
	
[EXEC/LOAD/JSON-DB.JS]
	
	This file acts as a JSON object database, which is used by JSON-SERVICE, but can be used 
	on the client side as well. 
	
[EXEC/LOAD/JSON-CLIENT.JS]

	This file is the gateway to the program's interbbs server. It contains the methods needed to 
	lock, unlock, read, write and delete objects from the server database.
	
[EXEC/JSON-SERVICE.JS]

	This file acts as an socket service. It contains the methods needed to lock, unlock,
	read, write and delete objects from the server database, and also accepts JSON-CLIENT connections
	and acts as the main source for all dynamic program data. The file also contains instructions for
	setting up a server.
	
[CTRL/JSON-SERVICE.INI]

	This file tells JSON-SERVICE.JS where a program's files are located.
	
	This file is critical for the service to operate properly. If you have installed the programs that 
	use this service to their default locations, no additional configuration should be required other 
	than to un-comment the lines corresponding with the games you wish to host.
	
[XTRN/<GAME_DIR>/SERVER.INI]

	This file should be located in the program's working directory, as it contains information for 
	the host and port the program will be connecting to. Deleting this file will cause
	your program not to function.
