    Welcome to The Beast's Domain, a Multi-Player, Interactive, Real-Time, ANSI
adventure game!  The Beast's Domain can handle up to 250 simultaneous players,
and is just as fun for BBS's with only a single line!
    This documentation will help you set-up The Beast's Domain for play on your
system, quickly and easily.

GAME SETUP:

    The first thing you'll need to do is make a sub-directory in your SBBS\XTRN
directory called TBD and copy all of the files you received with The Beast's
Domain into that directory, or, if you received the program on a floppy disk,
log into the floppy drive and type INSTALL.

    Next, run your Synchronet Configuration Utility, go into the External
Programs/Online Programs section and hit 'INS' to add an item.  Now set-up the
item you've just added as follows:

    Name                        The Beast's Domain
    Start-up Directory          C:\SBBS\XTRN\TBD    (or whatever yours is!)
    Command Line                TBD
    Clean-up Command Line
    Cost in Credits             0
    Access Requirements
    Execution Requirements
    ANSI Required               Yes
    Multi-User                  Yes
    Intercept I/O Interrupts    Yes
    Shrink BBS                  No
    Modify User Data            Yes             (<- doesn't matter for DEMO)
    Uses WWIV Color Codes       No
    Execute on Event            No
    BBS Drop File Type          Synchronet      XTRN.DAT
    Place Drop File In          Node Directory

    That's about all there is to setting the game up!  The Beast's Domain is
a self-maintaining game.  It runs maintenance routines on the dungeon each day
automatically.  Before the initial running of The Beast's Domain, you should
run the REROLL.EXE program, this will create the necessary data files for the
dungeon, and remove any old data and player files, you will probably only run
this program ONCE since the game (as previously mentioned) maintains itself.

    If you wish to have a message of your own displayed when a user enters
the game, you can create a file called TBD.SYS in the \SBBS\XTRN\TBD directory.
This file will be displayed to users upon entering the game.

    Go into the directory where you have placed the TBD files (e.g. at the
DOS prompt type CD \SBBS\XTRN\TBD), and run the TBDCFG program.  From the
opening screen you will be given a couple of options to choose from:

    Player Gold     (default is 0)
    Player Health   (default is 40)
    Player Weapon   (and displays the name and max damage done)
    Player Armor    (and displays the name and armor class)
    Exit Configuration Program

    These are the starting values players will get when entering your game.
Increasing the starting values helps give players a little push start in the
start of the game.
    When you are done editing the options to your liking press ESC or select
'Exit Configuration Program'.

    IMPORTANT NOTES:  If you already have The Beast's Domain installed on your
system, users currently in the game will not be affected by any configuration
changes until they have "died" and restarted from the beginning.  Configuration
settings ONLY work in the REGISTERED version of the game.

    There are currently 3 command line options for The Beast's Domain, they
are as follows:

    /COST=<credits/min>     Use this to have the game AUTOMATICALLY charge
                            users on a per minute basis to play.

    /TIMES=<times/day>      Use this to set up how many times per day a user
                            may play the game.

    /MAINT                  Force daily maintenance (can be used in place of
                            the automated daily maintenance).
