/* This is a message reader/lister door for Synchronet.  Features include:
 * - Listing messages in the user's current message area with the ability to
 *   navigate forwards & backwards through the list (and for ANSI users, a
 *   lightbar interface will be used, or optionally can be set to use a more
 *   traditional interface for ANSI users)
 * - The user can select a message from the list to read and optionally reply to
 * - For ANSI users, reading messages is done with an enhanced user interface,
 *   with the ability to scroll up & down through the message, move to the next
 *   or previous message using the right & left arrow keys, display the message
 *   list to choose another message to read, etc.
 * - The ability to start up with the message list or reading messages in the
 *   user's current message area (AKA sub-board)
 * - Message searching

 * ... Comments trimmed ...
 * 2023-09-22 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.80 beta
 *                              Improved speed of new-to-you scans, and to an extent (hopefully) overall speed
 *                              Bug fix: Setting reverseListOrder to "ask" in the .cfg file works properly again.
 *                              Bug fix: When listing messages in reverse order, the selected menu index
 *                              (for lightbar mode) is now correct.
 *                              Bug fix: If the user is allowed to read deleted messages, then allow
 *                              the left & right arrow keys to to the next/previous message if it's deleted.
 *                              Small fixes for indexed scanning mode.
 *                              New: For personal email, unread emails will have an 'unread' message indicator
 *                              in the message list as a U between the message number and the 'from' name.
 *                              New user setting: "Quit from reader to message list": When enabled,
 *                              quitting from reader mode goes to the message list instead of exiting
 *                              out of DDMsgReader fully.
 *                              New user setting: Enter/selection from indexed mode menu shows message list
 *                              (instead of going into reader mode)
 *                              New user setting: List messages in reverse order
 * 2023-10-10 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.80
 *                              Releasing this version
 * 2023-10-11 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.81
 *                              Updated permission check functions (speed improvement)
 * 2023-10-18 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.82
 *                              Fix for # posts and missing dates in sub-board list when changing sub-board
 * 2023-10-25 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.83
 *                              Personal emails to the sysop received as "sysop" (or starting with "sysop")
 *                              are now correctly identified and marked as read when read
 * 2023-10-26 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.84
 *                              Fix in reader mode for refreshing the message area after
 *                              closing another window (necessary with recent changes to
 *                              substrWithAttrCodes())
 * 2023-11-01 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.85
 *                              Mark personal email as read if the user is just reading personal email
 * 2023-11-09 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.86
 *                              New feature: For indexed mode, when choosing a sub-board, the R key
 *                              can be used to mark all messages as read in the sub-board.
 *                              Fix: For continuous newscan or browse newscan (SCAN_BACK),
 *                              call the stock Synchronet behavior (DDMsgReader did this previously,
 *                              as DDMsgReader doesn't implement those yet).
 *                              Fix: In the message list, to-user alternate colors weren't being used
 *                              unless the message was read. The correct colors are used again.
 * 2023-11-09 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.87 Beta
 *                              Trying to speed things up by not getting vote headers all the time
 *                              when calling get_all_msg_headers(), unless the vote headers are needed
 *                              (when the sysop views who votes on a message when viewing tally info)
 *                              New: User setting to only show new messages in a newscan (defaults to true/enabled)
 *                              In the message list, there is now an additional space before the
 *                              'from' name, in case one of the status characters is a letter (this should
 *                              look better).
 *                              New: In lightbar mode, the indexed newscan menu can optionally 'snap' to
 *                              the next sub-board with new messages when showing/returning to the menu
 *                              Fix: When listing personal email, messages to the user were written
 *                              with the to-user color wuen unread. Now the regular colors are always
 *                              used (since all of a user's personal emails are 'to' them).
 *                              Fix: For indexed newscan, if there are no sub-boards selected for scan
 *                              in the user's newscan configuration, then output a message and return.
 *                              Otherwise, it would end up in an infinite loop.
 *                              Updated how user settings are loaded, to ensure that default user settings
 *                              from DDMsgReader.cfg actually get set properly in the user settings.
 * 2023-11-23 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.88
 *                              New user setting/configuration option to prompt the user whether or
 *                              not to delete a personal email after replying to it (defaults to false).
 *                              New: Displays whether a personal email has been replied to.
 *                              Fix: Now displaying message vote score in the default header again.
 *                              Fix: When viewing message headers (for the sysop), now correctly
 *                              shows the message attributes.
 * 2023-11-30 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.89
 *                              New: User option to toggle whether to display the email 'replied' indicator
 *                              (defaults to true).
 *                              Fix for setting colors for the key help lines so that the background
 *                              won't get un-done if the other help line colors have a N (normal) attribute.
 * 2023-12-02 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.90 Beta
  *                             New: operator menu for read mode, with the option to add the author to the
 *                              twit list, etc.
 *                              Fix: When refreshing a rectangular area of a message, if it's a poll message,
 *                              the background color for the voted responses was used for the non-selected
 *                              responses.
 *                              Removed the setting useScrollingInterfaceForANSIMessages.

 *                              Releasing this version
 * 2023-12-12 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.90a
 *                              New configurable colors in the theme file for the indexed mode newscan menu:
 *                              indexMenuSeparatorLine (sub-board separator line) and indexMenuSeparatorText
 *                              (sub-board separator text)
 * 2023-12-15 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.90b
 *                              New configurable colors in the theme file for the indexed newscan menu
 *                              header text (indexMenuHeader), "NEW" indicator text (indexMenuNewIndicator),
 *                              and highlighted "NEW" indicator text (indexMenuNewIndicatorHighlight)
 * 2023-12-26 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.91
 *                              New sysop features while reading a message: Show message hex (with the X key)
 *                              and save message hex to a file (with Ctrl-X)
 * 2023-12-29 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.92
 *                              Indexed newscan: By default, if there are no new messages, it now shows
 *                              "No new messages." (578 QWKNoNewMessages from text.dat). There's a new user
 *                              setting to toggle whether to use the indexed newscan menu even if there are
 *                              no new messages. New configuration file option: displayIndexedModeMenuIfNoNewMessages,
 *                              which is a default for the user setting.
 * 2024-01-01 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.93
 *                              New user-toggleable behavior: Show indexed menu after reading all new messages.
 *                              Also, indexed reader mode (started with the -indexedMode command-line option)
 *                              now lists ALL sub-boards, rather than only sub-boards the user has enabled
 *                              for newscan. It also prompts the user to list sub-boards in the current group
 *                              or all.
 * 2024-01-04 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.93a Beta
 *                              Fix: For indexed read mode (not doing a newscan), when choosing a sub-board to
 *                              read, the correct (first unread) message is displayed. Also, the user's scan
 *                              pointer is also updated to the last_read pointer.
 * 2024-01-08 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.94
 *                              New operator option for read mode: Add author email to email.can.
 *                              New command-line option: -indexModeScope, which can specify the indexed
 *                              reader scope (group/all) without prompting the user.
 *                              User configuration options for newscan & email only shown when doing those actions
 * 2024-01-11 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95
 *                              Removed user option to display indexed mode menu in newscan after all new messages are read.
 *                              Command-line option -indexedMode can now be specified with -search=new_msg_scan to make
 *                              it display the indexed mode menu, regardless of the user setting to use the indexed mode
 *                              menu for a newscan.
 *                              New command-line option: -newscanIndexMenuAfterReadAllNew - Continue to display the
 *                              indexed mode menu after the user has read all new messages during a newscan.
 *                              The following command-line can be used to do a newscan for all sub-boards and continue
 *                              displaying the index mode menu after the user has read all new messages:
 *                              DDMsgReader.js -search=new_msg_scan -indexedMode -indexModeScope=all -newscanIndexMenuAfterReadAllNew
 *                              New indexed mode newscan behavior: R (mark all read) moves to the next sub-board.
 *                              Ctrl-S in the indexed mode menu re-scans sub-boards (to detect more new messages, etc.)
 *                              New DDMsgReader.cfg option for user config default:
 *                              indexedModeMenuSnapToNextWithNewAftarMarkAllRead
 * 2024-01-23 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95a
 *                              Bug fix: Abort when sub-board code isn't available when editing personal email
 * 2024-02-04 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95b
 *                              Bug fix: Use the P_UTF8 mode bit when printing UTF-8 message header info (such as 'from' and 'to').
 *                              A dd_lightbar_menu.js update goes along with this.
 * 2024-      Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95c
 *                              The filename of quotes.txt is now in the correct case for the user's editor.
 *                              "terminalSupportsUTF8 not defined" error eliminated.
 * 2024-03-31 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95d
 *                              Fix for checkmark refresh when selecting all/none in the message list
 * 2024-08-04 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95e
 *                              Fix: Indexed newscan mode for new users now shows the number of new messages
 *                              in sub-boards like it's supposed to.
 * 2024-08-09 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95f
 *                              New config option: msgSaveDir, which specifies the directory on the BBS PC
 *                              to save messages to. Can be empty, to use a full path inputted by the user.
 * 2024-08-12 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95g
 *                              Updates to help with the newscan issues placing the user at the first message, etc.
 * 2024-09-03 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.95h
 *                              Fix for saving an ANSI message to the local BBS PC
 * 2024-10-16 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96 Beta
 *                              Started working on sub-board sorting for changing sub-boards
 * 2024-10-24 Eric Oulashin     Updated for bbs.msg_number and bbs.smb_curmsg being writeable
 * 2024-10-25 Eric Oulashin     Message sub-board sort fixes
 * 2024-10-26 Eric Oulashin     User options for sub-board sorting when changing to another
 *                              sub-board, and whether to show sub-boards with new messages in
 *                              the indexed newscan.
 *                              Releasing this version (1.96).
 * 2024-11-02 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96a
 *                              When changing to another sub-board, the user can now cycle
 *                              through the sort options with the [ and ] keys. Also,
 *                              updated the change sub-board help to show in a scrollable
 *                              window for users with ANSI terminals, rather than simply
 *                              displaying the help with a pause at the end. Other help
 *                              screens could potentially be shown this way too.
 *                              New theme configuration options: helpWinBorderColor and
 *                              scrollingWinHelpTextColor
 * 2024-11-03 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96b
 *                              Bug fix: When displaying the new scrollable area change help
 *                              window, if there's an area change header in use, refresh it
 *                              and the header lines, since the scrollable help window would
 *                              display over them.
 * 2024-11-20 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96c
 *                              Bug fix: When showing a poll vote from the user, it should
 *                              show people who've voted - ensure it only counts vote responses
 * 2024-11-25 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96d
 *                              Bug fix: For the indexed-mode newscan, when showing only
 *                              sub-boards that have new messages, ensure the selected item
 *                              index is correct when re-populating the menu so that it doesn't
 *                              skip a sub-board.
 * 2024-11-26 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96e
 *                              When showing a poll result message, for the user who posted the poll,
 *                              show the answers from the people who voted on it. This is to
 *                              basically mimic the fact that Synchronet shows who voted on your
 *                              poll and what they answered, but in the poll message itself.
 * 2024-12-04 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96f
 *                              New user option & behavior: When selecting/toggling messages
 *                              in the message list, the user can now optionally have the cursor
 *                              go to the next message.
 * 2024-12-04 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96g
 *                              Bug fix: For indexed newscan without snap-to-new, go back to
 *                              remembering the user's previously selected sub-board
 * 2024-12-18 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96h
 *                              When reading messages with the scrolling interface, pay attention
 *                              to user input timeout via a check of the last user input.
 * 2024-12-22 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96i
 *                              When doing an indexed newscan, display the progress percentage
 *                              when doing the newscan
 * 2025-01-25 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96j
 *                              User timeout 'AreYouThere' message and disconnection are
 *                              more consistent with Synchronet's behavior. However, if the
 *                              scrollable reader or lightbar list interface is being used,
 *                              the 'AreYouThere' text will be set to a blank string for the
 *                              duration of this script's run due to how the text can interfere
 *                              with the screen and scrolling. The 'AreYouThere' sound will
 *                              still occur though, and the user will be disconnected if
 *                              they don't respond. getKeyWithESCChars() is no longer used
 *                              in favor of console.getkey().
 * 2025-02-08 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96k
 *                              Input timeout alert improvement - Rather than just blanking out
 *                              the AreYouThere text (which still allows the alert sound), now
 *                              also writes a text string at the bottom row when the input
 *                              timeout warning occurs. The string is configurable via the new
 *                              areYouThere string in the theme file.

 *                              After replying to a message, when it shows the status & pauses
 *                              for input, a Q or Ctrl-C will now exit, and not be ignored.
 * 2025-03-28 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96M
 *                              When reading messages, only mark it as read if it's to
 *                              the current user, including for personal email (i.e., when reading
 *                              sent mail, don't mark messages to others as read).
 * 2025-04-13 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96N
 *                              Changes (fixes) for the bottom-row key help lines due to
 *                              Synchronet fix related to @-code parsing (Git commit
 *                              fccf1a5718fdcb9864bcbccf2eb6de7ee50d3dd3). Hopefully the
 *                              mouse clicks are still correct.
 * 2025-04-15 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96o
 *                              Fix: For the sysop reading personal email addressed to
 *                              "sysop", mark the email as read
 * 2025-04-19 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96p
 *                              When viewing tally/vote information for a message (a
 *                              sysop feature), DDMsgReader can now optionally show
 *                              users' specific answers (in addition to just showing
 *                              who voted on the message/poll),  via the new
 *                              configuration option showUserResponsesInTallyInfo
 * 2025-04-20 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96q
 *                              If DDMsgReader.cfg doesn't exist, read DDMsgReader.example.cfg
 *                              (in the same directory as DDMsgreader.js) if it exists
 * 2025-05-10 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96r
 *                              When getting a message body, return a print mode of P_UTF8
 *                              or P_AUTO_UTF8 to ensure messages with UTF-8 are printed
 *                              correctly
 * 2025-05-15 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.96s
 *                              Fix: After replying to a netmail, pressing Q at the
 *                              pause prompt would cause the email header not to be
 *                              displayed when showing the message again, due to
 *                              console.aborted
 * 2025-06-14 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97 Beta
 *                              Now uses DDMsgAreaChooser for changing to another
 *                              sub-board. Built-in functionality (duplicated code)
 *                              has been removed.
 *                              New config option: DDMsgAreaChooser
 *                              Config options removed: areaChooserHdrFilenameBase,
 *                              areaChooserHdrMaxLines
 * 2025-06-18 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97
 *                              Releasing this version.
 * 2025-06-20 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97a
 *                              After displaying the indexed mode menu, don't display
 *                              the "Loading.." status again, which happened after
 *                              closing the user settings dialog
 * 2025-07-19 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97b
 *                              Bug fix: When listing messages, get the correct message
 *                              to read (both when listing in reverse and normal order).
 *                              Bug when listing in reverse reported by m1ndsurf3r in
 *                              the #synchronet IRC channel.
 * 2025-07-23 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97c
 *                              Bug fix: Get the correct message when choosing a personal
 *                              email when listing in reverse
 * 2025-08-27 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97d Beta
 *                              Replaced arrow keys in the key help lines since
 *                              some terminals can't display them.
 * 2025-09-02 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97d
 *                              Fix for "go to message" in lightbar mode (correctly
 *                              finding the message)
 * 2025-09-02 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97e
 *                              Fix: When listing messages in lightbar mode in reverse
 *                              order, deleting (with DEL) and toggling messages (with
 *                              the spacebar) now work on the correct message.
 * 2025-10-28 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97f
 *                              When reading a message, the sub-board information can
 *                              now be displayed by pressing S.
 * 2026-01-31 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97g
 *                              Bug fix: this.msgAreaList_lastImportedMsg_showImportTime
 *                              was being used in some functions where it didn't exist
 *                              anymore
 * 2026-02-07 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97h
 *                              Small refactoring in ReplyToMsg() related to the
 *                              MsgBase object; no functional change
 * 2026-02-11 Eric Oulashin     Version 1.97i
 *                              Commented out calls to bbs.scan_msgs() and bbs.scan_subs()
 *                              for now.  They were there to support reverting to stock
 *                              Synchronet functionality for modes not yet implemented,
 *                              but it's best to avoid that (due to recursive module
 *                              loading).  I'll need to look into how those modes work in
 *                              the stock Synchronet reader in order to replicate it with
 *                              DDMsgReader.

// object and/or message base object.  This is more complex than simple text substitution
// because message subject @-codes could include something like @MSG_SUBJECT-L######@
// or @MSG_SUBJECT-R######@ or @MSG_SUBJECT-L20@ or @MSG_SUBJECT-R20@.
//
// Parameters:
//  pTextLine: The line of text to search
//  pMsgHdr: The message header object
//  pDisplayMsgNum: The message number, if different from the number in the header
//                  object (i.e., if doing a message search).  This parameter can
//                  be null, in which case the number in the header object will be
//                  used.
//  pDateTimeStr: Optional formatted string containing the date & time.  If this is
//                not provided, the current date & time will be used.
//  pBBSLocalTimeZone: Optional boolean - Whether or not pDateTimeStr is in the BBS's
//                     local time zone.  Defaults to false.
//  pAllowCLS: Optional boolean - Whether or not to allow the @CLS@ code.
//             Defaults to false.
//
// Return value: A string with the complex @-codes substituted in the line with the
// appropriate message header information.

	<git_rswindell> https://gitlab.synchro.net/main/sbbs/-/commit/24226f351c85dabf3bc71713
	<git_rswindell>     Modified src/sbbs3/js_user.c
	<git_rswindell> New User class methods: can_access_sub() and can_access_dir()
	<git_rswindell> Much easier and more accurate way to determine (via JS) if a specific user
	<git_rswindell> has a particular kind of access to a message sub-board or a file directory.
	<git_rswindell> This is accurate because it uses the 'userdat' functions under the hood, which
	<git_rswindell> check much more than just a single access requirement string against the user.
	<git_rswindell> Usage:
	<git_rswindell> bool can_access_sub(string sub_code or number sub_num
	<git_rswindell>  [,'read', 'post', or 'operator'])
	<git_rswindell> bool can_access_dir(string dir_code or number dir_num
	<git_rswindell>  [,'download', 'upload', or 'operator'])
	<git_rswindell> If no access string (second argument) is specified, then just generic "access"
	<git_rswindell> (e.g. for listing areas) is checked.
	<git_rswindell> The existing msg_area.sub[].can_access, can_read, can_post (and similar for
	<git_rswindell> file_area.dir[]) are still useful, but only for the current 'user'. If you
	<git_rswindell> want to check a different user's access to a sub-board or file directory, you
	<git_rswindell> really need to use these new User class methods.
