=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
2.02     2022-02-13   Added the ability to do a file search (via filespec,
                      description, or new files since last scan).  A command-
                      line parameter, -MODE, specifies which search to perform
                      (search_filename, search_description, or new_file_search
                      for searching; list_curdir lists files in the user's
                      current directory, which is the default).
2.01     2022-02-07   Fixed file description being undefined when viewing file
                      info.  Fixed command bar refreshing when pressing the
                      hotkeys.  Added an option to pause after viewing a file
                      (defaults to true).
2.00     2022-02-06   Initial version.
