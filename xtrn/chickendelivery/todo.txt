Chicken Delivery 2 To-Do List
-----------------------------

-	Draw and save each level's structures (walls, platforms and stationary
	objects) in an ANSI editor.  Load each level's ANSI into a backdrop
	frame and use Frame.hasData(x, y) to check for collisions.  Revise the
	checkOverlap() function to use Frame.hasData(x, y), which will simplify
	its evaluations somewhat.
	-echicken
	
	*** use frame.getData(x,y) and not frame.hasData(x,y). use existing
	method to check collision with moving objects, use frame.getData(x,y)
	to check collision with stationary objects. 
	-mcmlxxix
	
	*** use a set character	to identify solid objects in backdrop ANSI's, 
	to allow for passable background scenery.

-	Add jumping enemies and an axis specifier for enemies in the level INI
	files (border coordinates become y instead of x if axis is set to y.)
	Or, give enemies the ability to hop from side to side as well.
	-echicken

-	Add moving platforms. They can be specified in the same way as enemies,
	with a starting point, borders and axis specifiers, and loaded as
	sprites from ANSI files. When they move, we'll have to check if the
	player (or an enemy) is occupying them and move both together.
	-echicken

-	Add downward drifting to flight while retaining the current jumping
	mechanism.  (Float downward in the direction of travel, or straight
	down if no direction chosen or if current direction cancelled by an
	opposite-direction keypress.)
	-echicken

-	Add a toggle to enemies to say that they can be killed if they're
	jumped on (checkOverlap, if below and if enemy and if toggle is true)
	with points awarded for killing.
	-echicken

-	Add collectable items / prizes (eg. coins or eggs or something that
	you gain points for collecting, or add up to earn free lives or an
	extra time bonus.)
	-echicken
	
	*** Add door keys or boxes of chicken that need to be retrieved before
	the level can be completed/door unlocked.
	-mcmlxxix

-	Powerups? Invincibility, long flight, high jump, egg throwing/dropping,
	running?
	-echicken

-	Boss rounds?  Could be loadable scripts that have different mechanics
	for "physics" and such, basically hacked versions of game.js, or could
	just take into account enemies that have a "life meter" and need to be
	jumped on or hit several times, etc.
	-echicken

-	Nonmoving but fatal objects (pits of lava, etc.)  Right now I'd do this
	by making an enemy that doesn't move, when really what I want is a more
	platform-like frame.
