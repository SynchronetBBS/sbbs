Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.06     2026-02-03   To quit out of a question set, the user can now use /Q,
                      /QUIT, or /EXIT (not simply Q, as that could be an answer
                      to a question).
1.05     2024-03-29   Ensure the correct script startup directory is always used
                      (make a copy of js.exec_dir on startup, since js.exec_dir
                      could change)
1.04     2024-03-26   Formatting fix for sysop menu when the server scores file
                      is missing.
                      Allow showing help when playing a game by entering ?
1.03     2023-01-14   Question sets (in the .qa files) may now have a section
                      of JSON metadata to specify the name of the category (if
                      different from simple filename parsing) and optionally
                      an ARS security string (overrides gttrivia.ini). Also,
                      answers can be specified as a JSON section to specify
                      multiple acceptable answers, and optionally a fact about
                      the answer/question. A new color setting, answerFact,
                      specifies the color to use to output the answer fact.
                      Also, fixed a bug in score JSON reading when the file
                      contents are very long.
1.02     2022-12-08   The game can now post scores in (networked) message sub-
                      boards as a backup to using a JSON DB server in case the
					  server can't be contacted.
1.01     2022-11-25   Added the ability to store & retrieve scores to/from a
                      server, so that scores from multiple BBSes can be
                      displayed.  By default, it's configured to use Digital
                      Distortion as the host.  There are also sysop functions
                      to remove players and users from the hosted inter-BBS
                      scores. Also, answer clues now don't mask spaces in the
                      answer.
1.00     2022-11-18   Initial version/release
