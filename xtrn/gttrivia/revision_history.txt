Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.03     2023-01-05   Question sets (in the .qa files) may now have a section
                      of JSON metadata to specify the name of the category (if
					  different from simple filename parsing) and optionally
					  an ARS security string (overrides gttrivia.ini). Also,
					  answers can be specified as a JSON section to specify
					  multiple acceptable answers, and optionally a fact about
					  the answer/question. A new color setting, answerFact,
					  specifies the color to use to output the answer fact.
1.02     2022-12-08   The game can now post scores in (networked) message sub-
                      boards as a backup to using a JSON DB server in case the
					  server can't be contacted.
1.01     2022-11-25   Added the ability to store & retrieve scores to/from a
                      server, so that scores from multiple BBSes can be
                      displayed.  By default, it's configured to use Digital
                      Distortion as the host.  There are also sysop functions
                      to remove players and users from the hosted inter-BBS
                      scores. Also, answer clues now don't mask spaces in the
                      answer.
1.00     2022-11-18   Initial version/release
