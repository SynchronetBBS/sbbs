Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.01     2022-11-25   Added the ability to store & retrieve scores to/from a
                      server, so that scores from multiple BBSes can be
                      displayed.  By default, it's configured to use Digital
                      Distortion as the host.  There are also sysop functions
                      to remove players and users from the hosted inter-BBS
                      scores. Also, answer clues now don't mask spaces in the
                      answer.
